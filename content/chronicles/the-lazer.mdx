    Today's card adventure returns with another box full of <i>card & coin</i> BOGO cards, this time of the football variety. While I football is third behind basketball & baseball in terms of card count, it's also third in terms of my favorite sports to collect behind basketball & hockey - so......at least it's consistent?

    Let's take a look at the batch of keepers from this box:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="the-lazer/football" />

    You'll note cards lumped together in the following order:
    - Minnesota Vikings (nephews)
    - We like people named Joe
    - James is a narcissist
    - Current or future HOFers
    - Green Bay Packers, current & former
    - Anyone named Davis stays with me [IYKYK]
    - Wisconsin Badger

    The real prizes though?

    Just a couple of the GOATs in the running back category. Bo knows Barry.

    I'm writing this while we are en route to Minneapolis and the weather/roads aren't great. Hopefully, the lord is my sheppard or whatever. <i>nikkigirl</i> is doing a great job letting jesus take the wheel or something.

    Anywho, we come bearing belated xmas presents for <i>the lazer</i>, including this box that I made for him:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="the-lazer/lazer" />

    I keep all of the card boxes I get, no matter how raggity they may be. Not only do I write the release numbers a box has contributed to, I also name every box as it enters my workflow.

    [v.2.6.27](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls/102) is the label of this chronicle card (scroll up, see the upper left corner), and it was stamped onto the box as well. [v.2.4.20](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls/58), also written on this box, is from when I first started to sort and organize the last big batch of <i>card & coin</i> cards. Release v.2.4.20 was lumping cards together by sport and loading them into boxes in preparation to being loaded into <i>tcdb</i>. The football cards loaded above where also part of that release.

    Serendipity; the circle of life.

    As for the name, BOX-17-HEISMAN, BOX is the series name (there are many series), 17 indicates this is the seventeenth box I have labeled (we're into the 60s at this point I think), and HEISMAN refers to Heisman trophy winning quarterback, <i>charlie ward</i>, who wore #17. <i>chuck</i> is a whole other 2-sport story, just like our pal <i>bo jackson</i> from those same football cards above.

    Serendipity; unplanned coinky-dinks.

    Point being, I stuffed this box full of cards for the <i>the lazer</i>, decorated said box, and I look forward to seeing his reaction to the cards when he opens it. It's a serious box of cards, and his collection just leveled up several levels. I created a [laszlo collection](https://www.tcdb.com/Collection.cfm/member/tullyelly/collection/21) on <i>tcbd</i> to help track what I turn over to him (not listed there: a bunch of Pokemon are also included).

    Finally, the box has a QR code on it that points back to this post right here. A timeless treasure, one way or another.

    One hopes.
