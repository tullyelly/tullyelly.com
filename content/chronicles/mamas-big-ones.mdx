At some unknown point this morning I had an idea for today's post and had a moment to decide whether to document it or trust the process. Well, I forgot. It's lost.

With that in mind, let's talk about <i>mama's big ones</i>. I actually only know one big one off of <i>cass elliot</i>'s album, but what an album name. Who doesn't like big ones? Let's check in on my personal favorite big one, <i>make your own kind of music</i>:

If there's anything I'll say to the kiddos over and over.......and over again that I hope they take fully to heart: it's the idea of making your own kind of music. I might go full dad mode and rant and rave about this or that, only to finish the thought with "now do you". Listen to me, listen to your mothers, listen to your teachers, listen to the lord himself, but make your own way. Make your own path. Take in your world, make it your own.

<i>make your own kind of music</i>

There are also those amongst us, the enlightened perhaps, that will also recognize this song from where I discovered it. I was just chillin' when desmond popped up on my favorite TV show:

I've probably spent more total hours watching <i>lost</i> than any other TV show or movie. Last time I made it maybe 7 episodes in. Sometimes I make it all the way through pretty quickly, sometimes it will take me a year or two to make it through. I always have to go back.

One of these days I'll get around to documenting my one and only series of paintings, simply titled <i>lost</i>.

Anywho, remember what happened to the idea I had earlier today?
