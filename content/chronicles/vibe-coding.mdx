I don't really feel the inspiration tonight so I veered off into a bit of vibe coding. [What is vibe coding?](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-vibe-coding)

As a result you will see two new things at the bottom on this (and all) blog post(s).

First, you can now click a link at the bottom of the most current post to move backwards to the last post. Additionally, if you are not on the first, or the last post, you will be able to move forwards and backwards from any point you land within the chronicles universe. And if you have the balls to go to the [first post](/shaolin/hello-world), you can navigate forward from there.

Next, I added a few of the cards found on the [homepage](/) to the end of each blog post. These changes will hopefully make it a touch easier to follow along and/or catch up should you fall behind.

Thrilling, ain't it?
