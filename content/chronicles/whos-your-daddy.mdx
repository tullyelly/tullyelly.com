I'm down to the last few days for my window to get insurance taken care of, and today I submitted the kids birth certificates along with my marriage license, leaving me to think all is well. Well.......I'm not on the little two's birth certificates. Every few years I remember how poorly documented this is, and this was no different. I had to cobble together 3 half completed documents, plus the court case where I took responsibility, and then had to explain how my name used to be a different name; leaving this poor HR person with a weird look into my long strange journey.

I was joking about it with my team and when one suggested I get a DNA test, another chimed in, with 100% sincerity, that I should be careful before going the nuclear route. You never know what it might tell me.

  Mental note: I need to learn more about this man's background. lol

Everything worked out just fine in the end. So I've been married twice you see, just to the same woman......

Day 1 of month 2 at the office today. I stepped square into the middle of some office politics that are torpedoing a project I'm involved in, and this week's primary goal is to smooth over what I stepped in.

It's oddly comforting to know that one shitshow usually ends up sharing a lot of the same traits as the last shitshow. We just can't help ourselves as a species, no matter which corporate buzzwords you layer over the mix.
