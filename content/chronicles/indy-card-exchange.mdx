  Day one of the tournament went pretty well overall. Large facility, long line to get in, but generally speaking, nice accommodations. 
  
  Here was the schedule:

    The first match against Academy 17E Black got off to a bit of a slow start before the boys took it too them. Dominated 25-15, up 1-0.

    While the second set was much closer than it should have been, the boys pulled it out with a hard fought 25-23 victory. Game, set, match: 2-0.

    In the second match against MVC 17-Brad it looked to be evenly matched from the beginning. After building up a decent lead I thought to myself, self, maybe it isn't all that evenly matched. Well MVC came back, made it close, but couldn't pull it out in the end. CCVBC victory, 28-26, up 1-0.

    The next set got off to a decent start before we [let go of the rope](/shaolin/failure), helping them get out ahead, and even though we fought back at the end, we couldn't quite pull it out. 20-25 loss, match now tied 1-1.

    After giving away the first two points and making me nervous, the bois finished strong to pull out a 15-13 victory. 2-1 match win.

    The last match of the day against Cinci Attack 17 Gold got off to a strong start, only to lose 17-25. They really lost their cool and did themselves in this set. 0-1.

    They started off the second set strong once again, only to hit another rough patch where they were their own worst enemy. This time they fought back, but couldn't pull it out in the end. 23-25 loss, 0-2. Game, set, match (bad guys).
