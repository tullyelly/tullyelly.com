  Day one of the tournament went pretty well overall. Large facility, long line to get in, but generally speaking, nice accommodations. 
  
  Here was the schedule:

    The first match against Academy 17E Black got off to a bit of a slow start before the boys took it too them. Dominated 25-15, up 1-0.

    While the second set was much closer than it should have been, the boys pulled it out with a hard fought 25-23 victory. Game, set, match: 2-0.

    Check out ya boi:

    In the second match against MVC 17-Brad it looked to be evenly matched from the beginning. After building up a decent lead I thought to myself, self, maybe it isn't all that evenly matched. Well MVC came back, made it close, but couldn't pull it out in the end. CCVBC victory, 28-26, up 1-0.

    The next set got off to a decent start before we [let go of the rope](/shaolin/failure), helping them get out ahead, and even though we fought back at the end, we couldn't quite pull it out. 20-25 loss, match now tied 1-1.

    After giving away the first two points and making me nervous, the bois finished strong to pull out a 15-13 victory. 2-1 match win.

    The last match of the day against Cinci Attack 17 Gold got off to a strong start, only to lose 17-25. They really lost their cool and did themselves in this set. 0-1.

    They started off the second set strong once again, only to hit another rough patch where they were their own worst enemy. This time they fought back, but couldn't pull it out in the end. 23-25 loss, 0-2. Game, set, match (bad guys).

    On the way out I found out that they are ready for spring training here in Indiana. 42 degrees and ready to ball.

  Whoopsies! One minute I was volleyballing and the next?

![indy card exchange](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/indy-card-exchange.webp)

Can't imagine how I ended up in a card shop again. Like seriously, I should get checked out. I never remember how I end up inside these places. And this one was packed to the gills. Multiple registers, all kinds of tables, legit collectors scrounging through boxes.

Let's see what we found:

![prizm black](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/prizm-black.webp)

Did I buy like 75 Prizm Black base cards? Yes, yes I did. Cheap base that I wouldn't normally find. Noice.

![bucks](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/bucks.webp)

Always gotta score my bois.

![black gold](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/black-gold.webp)

Topps Black Gold, and a KG RC? Now we are talking.

![numbered](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/numbered.webp)

Let's take a detour and score some numbered Hockey cards.

![mcjesus](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/mcjesus.webp)

Hard to believe that <i>mcjesus</i> isn't the bell of the ball.

![celebrini](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/celebrini.webp)

Oh, new guy alert! <i>celebrini</i> is my newest favoritest man crush. These are the first two cards in what I hope will be a long journey together.

![freak](/images/optimized/indy-card-exchange/freak.webp)

Nobody beats the <i>freak</i> though. This [2014-15 Panini Select - Prizms Silver #75 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/110837/cid/7757262/2014-15-Panini-Select---Prizms-Silver-75-Giannis-Antetokounmpo) is an absolute beauty.

Overall, fun store. Super busy, though it's hard to knock them for that.

Recommend.

  Notice the new border colors in the two sections above? Yeah, me neither. I
  can't say I'm thrilled with the styling, but the point of the story is that I
  have two new release sections now. One for volleyball tournaments, and one for
  when I visit a new local card shop.

I've got a longer-term idea or two for each.

  My day started out by giving a small valentine candy to <i>nikkigirl</i> that said: "kiss me". 
  
  She did.

I win.
