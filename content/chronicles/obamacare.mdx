    It's pretty rare that I get a 100% <i>fear the deer</i> themed trades. That <i>thon</i> rookie year Teal Explosion is kinda ill. Dennis always comes through. Speaking of Dennis coming through:

    I love a good ol' fashioned piece of paperwork. I hope ye never dies.

    Here's the winner of the deal though:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="obamacare/rashad" />

    A nice clean /100 rookie year <i>rashad</i>.

    Aaron consistently delivers the goods. How about a little bit of this?

    With a bit of mid-2000s Topps Finest:

    And then we add a <i>x-men</i>/<i>magneto</i> cherry on top:

    These are a few of my favorite things (matchmaker).

    TL:DR; I always try to be a good trade partner. Whatever I receive, I try to return in spades. That might be <i>tcdbd</i>, <i>nikkigirl</i>, the kiddos, family, friends, co-workers, or some rando off the street.

    Amplify others. Everyone can get it like Obamacare.

        Keep it buddy, they don't want no problems here

    PS.......I listened to this song on the way home after dropping <i>jeff-meff</i> off at volleyball practice, realized it was the name of today's blog, and then just double realized the lyrics that triggered the post has Michael Jordan.......and Take 2, Day 23.......numberology wizardry.

    Be a [GOAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan).
