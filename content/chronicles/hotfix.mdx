The last few days I've been seeing this warning on [vercel](https://vercel.com/home):

![oh no](/images/optimized/hotfix/oh-no.webp)

I couldn't stand it if someone hacked my shit and found out what a big cry baby I am. Or maybe they get really mean and change it so I only have [2 giannis cards](/cardattack/tcdb-rankings) in my collection. I actually wouldn't be too upset if someone started blogging for me every now and again without my permission. Let's get wild with it.

Anywho, it's been a few weeks since I've [released](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) anything on my (personal) project plan so it's nice to increment that number again to eliminate a bug.

As per usual, I argued with the robot for awhile before we figured it out.
