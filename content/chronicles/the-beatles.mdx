    I've got a bit of a white boi winter going, starting with <i>the beatles</i>:

    <i>nikkigirl</i> and I recently watched the [Anthology](https://www.disneyplus.com/whats-on/series/the-beatles-anthology) series and ever since I've been listening to their albums in the order of release, to include all of their solo releases as I continue the adventure. I've made it through 1969 [niiice] a few times and need to get back to this mission to continue into the 70's.

    I didn't get into <i>the beatles</i> until my early twenties and I can vividly remember pirating all of their albums when we lived on Tayco St. See this computer?

    Okay, focus. Stop looking at the cutie pies and focus on the computer in the back left. I still have this tower, filled with terabytes of media, including every <i>beatles</i> album, AND still have that sound system tucked away around here somewhere. Just in case.

    Tayco St. memories are bittersweet though. Bittersweet.

    Want some more white boi winter? I've been revisiting Eminem recently as well. There's some <i>slim shady</i> takes built up around here somewhere. Soon perhaps. Soon.

    <i>eeeeeeeemma</i> got back to the real world yesterday, and I got to hug her again for the first time in 2026 this morning. She also started her new job today and now she's officially a co-worker of <i>nikkigirl</i>, <i>lulu</i>, and <i>p-funk</i>. Watch out world!

    I thought for sure she'd bring back a new friend I saw she made:

    Alas, only <i>corbin</i>, no parrot to be found.

    What a gross photo otherwise. lol

    Before we check out for the day, let's look at my favorite of <i>lulu</i>'s engagement photos:

    <i>nikkigirl</i> does not like my choice. Haterz gon' hate.
