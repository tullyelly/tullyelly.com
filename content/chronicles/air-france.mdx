  Before we go anywhere else, let's take off on Air France. Remember when I said
  that I owed a French pal a trade? No? [Well I
  do](/shaolin-scrolls/strange-brew).

    One of my favorite things about Vivien is that he's always chasing 90's NBA. That means we've got a sicko on our hands, and I like sickos. There's also a decent batch of inserts and parallels flying out the door so we should be getting something fun in return. I don't actually remember much about the return package, so that's like a double win. The first time I agreed to the deal, and the second time I remember what that deal is on mail day.

    Or something.

    What's that? Hockey you say? I accept.

    I love the oddball football card to lead it off too. What can I say though?
