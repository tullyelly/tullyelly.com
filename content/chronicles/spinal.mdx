In preparing for everyone that stopped over for thanksgiving, I had the temerity to bend over and put some shoes down. Well, I broke my back. Spinal.

lol, what a terrible quality gif. I like it.

My back though? It currently likes nothing. Move slow. Lift nothing.

Lazy dayz today. We have watched a bunch of the new (old) Beatles documentary on Disney+. Always entertaining to see the boys in action.

In between being lazy, I started working my way through a stack of cards I purchased from [@euphoriccards](https://x.com/euphoriccards) many months ago. I've been doing stack sales with him going back to 2022. He's really the only person I still stack with anymore.

Good dude.
