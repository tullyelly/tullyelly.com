    I managed to corrupt my local repo last night or today, and while his wasn't as dramatic of a problem as the last time I borked myself like this, it's still annoying and lost time. I'm finding the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about)  to be pretty buggy and I'm wondering if I shouldn't just find a way to run full Linux, somewhere, somehow.

    It's one of those things that sounds really cool and fun, but I've got bigger fish to fry right now. And/or a lack of mental capacity, and/or a lack of time, and/or you get the point. Now, if what I'm doing right now to bring things back up goes horribly wrong or this happens again for the 3rd time in a few weeks......I might just git er dun.

    Hey look at that, it looks like we are back - it worked. Because I just brute force these kinds of fixes to include the most current releases of the packages I'm using, I ended up upgrading from Next 16.1.3 to 16.1.6. A random 30 minutes forced upon me ends up in an upgrade.

    Let's call that fate.

    Iterate.

    We spent the majority of the day supporting <i>jeff meff</i>'s volleyball adventures:

    They played a string of some of the top teams in the country and while they didn't win any sets, they hung tight with some tough competition. Back at it tomorrow.

    I added another prop to the ReleaseSection component and now, when I post the cards I have received from a trade and mark it completed, it will link back to the first post showing the cards I shipped out the door in a deal.

    I might add a cool badge or something to give a nicer visual cue for fun. That's for later though.

    Iterate.

  First trade that I started logging using my new <i>tcdb</i> tooling to come to a close. Check this beauty out:

    How about some 1980 nostalgia for the win? I love an oddball card/sticker like this. I love me some <i>pac-man</i>. Gorgeous.

    Looks like the link back to the original post works as intended, and now I notice there is no return link on the original post. Always more to chase.

    Just like a batch of ghosts.
