<ReleaseSection alterEgo="tullyelly">
    Today in coding.......sharpened the way MDX renders bulleted lists so that it doesn't spawn a bunch of paragraphs when Prettier comes along to keep things tidy.

    Also fixed some extra padding or spacing that occurs near the footer in the mobile version. File this one under OCD and nobody gives a fuck.

    Next minor fix was to address clicking the "home" button while on the homepage (or any page and clicking the link back to that page) causes the loading animation to hang. This was because landing on a new route (page) cleans up and finishes the loading animation - and in our case, cleanup was not happening. I'm not super thrilled with how the loading animation works, but not enough to start fighting that battle again.

    After all that, we circled back to the touch interface for the menus. Menus open just fine via desktop touch, but clicking any individual menu did not take us anywhere. This one I fought for most of the day. Menu tests are incredibly fickle and it often feels like a game of wack-a-mole to get something deployed. Still fighting this and we'll continue that battle tomorrow.

  Other than that, a pretty low key day. Bunch of card stuff, sports ball, and
  what not. Bucks lost, but the game was fun. Packers are currently losing, but
  maybe.......and now they are up 10 and Aaron looks sad. Good time to close
  this book.
