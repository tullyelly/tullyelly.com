    I don't think I'll contribute much today. I'm behind on laundry, and my brain
    could use a good washing too. Maybe I'll hop in with the underoos and wash the
    shit away across the board.

    I put the music on random again and waited for something to speak to me. Looks like song #10 landed that plane and here we are:

    <YouTubeVideo id="CRbuk1ajz7o" orientation="landscape" />

    First, <i>DOOM</i> sampling <i>the beatles</i> and not getting hammered in court speaks to just how unknown he was when this dropped. Today? I don't think this song can be made. Anywho, so dope.

    What spoke to me was the adlibs to kick off the song, mostly by <i>DOOM</i>. Let's follow the back and forth:

    <b>MF Grimm</b>:<br/>
    <i>You know when you gonna come in?</i>

    <b>DOOM</b>:<i><br/>
    Nobody will never ever, ever, really, really know<br/>
    Cuz the more you know, the more you know that you don't know shit<br/>
    N*****'ll never run out of shit<br/>
    There's so much shit, so much scripts to do here<br/>
    N*****'ll never run out of shit</i>

    <b>MF Grimm</b>:<i><br/>
    Enjoy the rollercoaster ride.</i>

    <b>DOOM</b>:<i><br/>
    Multifaceted.</i>

    Simple framing. Simple world.

    I'm switching it up a bit this week and will be chipping away at this puzzle:

    ![deadpool & wolverine](/images/optimized/tick-tick/puzzle.webp)

    Puzzles help center me within the idea that no matter how big the problem is, be it 100 pieces, 500 pieces, or 1000 pieces, the solution always begins with a single piece. I think this 500 piece puzzle found at [powers comics](https://www.facebook.com/PowersComics/) in Green Bay is the right medium size puzzle to keep my hands busy while also allowing my mind to wander through a sea of potential solutions.

    If memory serves, I paid twice as much as was needed for this puzzle because the proceeds went directly to an animal shelter program they run on the side and I can be a sucker for a kind heart. Maybe that sneaks in some good karma while we do some heavy thinking.

    Shouts to <i>derek</i> for getting me in the shop and helping me find it.
