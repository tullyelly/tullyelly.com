    [Yesterday's release](/shaolin/avenue-q) was #[100](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls/100). Round numbers! Arbitrary numbers! 100!

    Ok, technically this is the 97th release because there is a bug/error somewhere in my process and IDs 85, 90, and 95 were skipped, even though it should not theoretically be possible. I think I know what causes it, and there's plans for better - even still, mistakes were made. 97% ain't too bad though.

    Point being, we are celebrating #100 regardless of how true it actually is. Seems to fit the times we live in. lol

    Sorry <i>lulu</i> this one is gonna be one of those chronicles that doesn't make much sense to you. At least you get a shout-out and can catch up with <i>nikkigirl</i>......shoot, now I've got to log both of your names. Darn it.

    Maybe next time.

    Today's gonna be a walk through self reflection, the work that's been done so far, and how it's been done along the way. The vast majority of numbers to be discussed happened within the last 90-120 days.

    First up, 660. I'm up to 660 total tasks logged into my [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) project planning software, with 582 having been completed. Some of those 78 unfinished items are dead ideas, and I'm working on cleaning up and/or reusing tasks where possible. Since re-joining the workforce, I've also slowed down on how much I'm planning ahead so that number is also naturally dwindling.

    <ScrollAmendment><i>lulu</i> translation: I plan ahead and track my work as much as possible.</ScrollAmendment>

    Outside of the planning and tracking, there's also the doing. Within this same timeframe, I've merged 320 pull requests, consisting of 1,149 total commits. Here's how that's been spread out:

    Within those commits, here's the breakdown of how much code has been added or removed along the way:

    The week with largest spikes both up and down? That's when the blog hatched itself. It could also be considered a visual representation of my manic tendencies. Not to suggest I've been diagnosed with anything - which is only because I'd never sit with someone long enough to diagnose me......lol. I digress.

    <ScrollAmendment><i>lulu</i> translation: I'm diligent, dedicated, and I will do something thousands of times in a row if it speaks to my soul.</ScrollAmendment>

    Last but not least, and perhaps the most fun to me - what languages am I using?

    <ScrollAmendment><i>lulu</i> translation: When I talk to the computer, sometimes I have to speak to it like it's made up of different parts of that world to get things done. Sometimes I speak French, sometimes I can speak English, and sometimes I have to speak Spanish to it. But like, TypeScript, MDX, and SQL instead.</ScrollAmendment>

    100 releases is a big deal for me. 660 ideas is a big deal for me. 1100+ commits is a big deal for me. On my birthday, I committed (pun intended) myself to getting better. These are the numbers that prove to me that I am doing what I said I would do to myself.

    Me, myself, and I.

    Yesterday I forgot to add the playlist that inspired the work so I combined it with today (last two albums). The last two days of content was brought to you by the following vibes.
