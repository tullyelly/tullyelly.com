  Hey <i>tcdb</i> folks, I'll get to boring you in just a few moments.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="theabbott">
    <i>nikkigirl</i> and I walked over to watch <i>eeeeeeeemma</i> perform in this year's school play, [Avenue Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Q).

    Much more to come on the musical. Please hold.

    In other kid news, <i>jeff meff</i> had a tournament in Chicago this weekend (mom's covering this weekend), and let's see what he was up to......

    Boom. On they head.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" releaseId="99">
    Today's star of the show, Mr. Jennings, will make an appearance shortly. First, let's start with the backstory of today's batch of cards loaded into <i>tcdb</i>:

    ![the rest](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/the-rest.webp)

    The two stacks on the left go into the PC, and the two stacks on the right go onto the for sale/trade list.

    Overall, I processed a few hundred cards that I got from a stack sale run by [euphoric cards](https://x.com/euphoriccards) on X. He's basically the last stacker that I still rock with on X, and in this case, I bought most of what is pictured above as a bulk deal. He offered what he didn't sell during one of his stack sales at a steep discount, and I took the opportunity to add them to my stack.

    Dude is easily one of my favorite people in the hobby. Always reliable, friendly, and willing to collaborate to get a deal done.

    How about some randos?

    ![kat six seven](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/kat-six-seven.webp)

    <LoopedGIF src="/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/six-seven.webp" alt="six seven" />

    Aside from the stupid card inspiring the joke gif, we've got <i>kat</i>, and <i>devin vassel</i> making an appearance. <i>kat</i> makes the PC because I hoard <i>t-wolves</i> for my nephews, and <i>vassel</i> played for <i>florida state</i> - my favorite team still doing racism (lol omg jk).

    All three cards are numbered.

    This block, we call <i>kobe</i> plus.

    ![kobe plus](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/kobe-plus.webp)

    Here we've got <i>kobe</i>, plus <i>splash mountain</i>, and <i>hali</i>. If I see a <i>black mamba</i> for $2, I'm scooping it up without question. This one goes into the for sale/trade area because it's a duplicate, while the <i>brook</i> stays to be loved forever, and the <i>tyrese</i> showed up to help me keep up [on his leaderboard](shaolin/strange-brew).

    Time to take a brief detour into sadness.

    ![dame time](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/dame-time.webp)

    Well that trade didn't work out too well, eh? A little too much Star Gazing if you ask me.

    <i>dame time</i> will be revisted with more depth in due (dame) time.

    He's a super freak, super freak, he's super freaky.......

    ![giannis](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/giannis.webp)

    Would you believe these are all duplicates?

    ![giannis leaderboard](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/giannis-leaderboard.webp)

    Oh, I guess I do have a lot of the world's greatest hero. Wait, is that a......

    <LoopedGIF src="/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/six-seven.webp" alt="six seven" />

    I believe this joke may have officially jumped the shark.

    Normally, nobody would top <i>giannis</i> as the blog closer, but today's special guest deserves some extra shine:

    ![brandon jennings](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/brandon-jennings.webp)

    Up top we have [2009-10 Panini Court Kings #124 Brandon Jennings](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/10063/cid/785444/2009-10-Panini-Court-Kings-124-Brandon-Jennings), numbered to /649, which immediately becomes my favorite RC of his. On the left we have [2015-16 Panini Prestige - True Colors Prime #TC-BJ Brandon Jennings](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/119684/cid/8149254/2015-16-Panini-Prestige---True-Colors-Prime-TC-BJ-Brandon-Jennings), numbered to /25 (ooh that's pretty low!), and on the right we have [2014-15 Panini Immaculate Collection #15 Brandon Jennings](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/106950/cid/7655676/2014-15-Panini-Immaculate-Collection-15-Brandon-Jennings), numbered to /99.

    How'd he end up on the <i>pistons</i> you ask? Well, he was in [the deal](https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/9522945/detroit-pistons-acquire-brandon-jennings-sign-trade-milwaukee-bucks-according-sources) that landed us <i>khris middleton</i>. <i>middleton</i>, a [55 point](https://www.espn.com/nba/game/_/gameId/291114015/warriors-bucks) game as a rookie, and the fact that he is the inspiration for the phrase <i>bucks in 6</i> are the primary reasons he gets his own post today.

    What's [bucks in 6](https://www.jsonline.com/story/sports/nba/bucks/2018/04/21/so-where-does-bucksin-6-sentiment-come/539149002/)? That link will fill you in, and this video will get you to the origin story of it all:

    While <i>brandon jennings</i> played a more-than-meets-the-eye role in the 2020-21 <i>milwaukee bucks</i> championship season, he hadn't offically gotten his own section in the PC yet. Until today that is!

    This fun batch of cards inspired me to load him into the [tcdb rankings](/cardattack/tcdb-rankings/1103) app and here's where he checks in on the leaderboard:

    ![jennings leaderboard](/images/optimized/brandon-jennings/jennings-leaderboard.webp)


    Normally, he would get his own unique hashtag upon entering the PC, but not this fine gentleman. He is <i>bucks-n-six</i>.

    <i>bucks-n-six</i> is he.

    Shout out to the <i>live from the garden</i> chat, they got all of my best work today. To sum it up for them, <i>common</i> is THE Chicago artist for me, above all else.

    Today's content was brought to you by the following vibes.
