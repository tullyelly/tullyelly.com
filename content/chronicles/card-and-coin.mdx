<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" releaseId="96">
    One of my favorite things in "the hobby" is hitting up [card & coin](https://www.cardandcoingreenbay.com/) in Green Bay and buying their buy one, get one free white envelopes. They stuff envelopes full of 20-30 cards and charge $1, so I can score 40-60 cards for that same $1. Now, these envelopes aren't full of anything super amazing, but they are perfect for a set collector like myself. They have all sports, plus some mixed envelopes, and while they aren't going to make me rich, there's always something fun to be found.

    <i>eeeeeeeemma</i> was the last one to pick me up some and she cleared them out of all of the basketball envelopes. She's a helpful one that one.

    Plus, the supplies they sell are super duper cheap. Most cards shops gauge for supplies, but <i>card & coin</i> treats them like a loss leader and frankly, it works on me. It's a long running joke with <i>nikkigirl</i>: "best prices in town!".

    Anywho, I had a small box full of 200 or so hockey cards waiting to get sorted and loaded into <i>tcdb</i> from these BOGO envelopes. Hockey, it turns out, is my second favorite sport to collect. I stumbled back into being a hockey fan in the past 4 or 5 years when I fell in love with <i>connor mcdavid</i>, aka <i>mcjesus</i>. This is the play that got me hooked:

    That's a whole nother story though. Shout out to <i>mr. allen</i>.

    As previously noted, there's really nothing all that great in this batch of cards - the hockey envelopes tend to be the least fun ones - and yet, there's always something. Here's a few <i>minnesota north stars</i> rookie cards I'm saving for my nephews:

    The real winner of the bunch is this HOF rookie card for Rob Blake:

    This might be worth dozens, if not hundreds, of pennies.

    And I love it.
