We (nikkigirl, eeeeeeeemma, and I) started the day with some breakfast, joined by donnie and gina at SAP. SAP is our go-to and it was donnie and gina's first time, if memory serves.

Great breakfast, great family time, and great juice.

Next up: filling out boring paperwork with eeeeeeeemma. We are paperwork bros.

Then it was on to [tim's sports cards & die-cast](https://www.facebook.com/p/Tims-Sports-Cards-Nascar-Die-Cast-100057430360846/) to meet up with derek for some card chasing. It was customer appreciation day, so there were door prizes, raffles, discounts, free food and a good ol' fashioned giannis RC chase. 3 packs, no RC.

Next we headed up to sturgeon bay to checkout a new shop, [spuds cards](https://www.facebook.com/p/Spuds-Cards-61577834255667/). Here we scored some shaq rookies and jordan 92-93 ultra cards from ripping some wax. I walked out with these as well:

![deion sanders starting lineup](/images/optimized/giannis-chase/deion.webp)

<br />
If ya see ya boi, ya grab ya boi. The sterling is apparently some white jersey
variation that's a bit harder to find. I believe everything I see on the
internet - so it must be true.

We finished up at [green bay city cards](https://www.facebook.com/greenbaycitycards/) so that derek could score some supplies. I walked out with this:

<br />I thought that I had the green jersey version (non-chase) so I grabbed
with "chase" white jersey version. I already have the white one it turns out.
Guess I gotta go back for the other!
