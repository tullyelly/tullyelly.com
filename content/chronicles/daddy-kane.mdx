I started the day by finishing the sorting, loading, and overall organization of [2005 topps football](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewSet.cfm/sid/4718/2005-Topps). I don't typically chase the completion of football sets, but I like to let jesus take the wheel and let me know when the exception proves the rule. 3 things pulled this onto the to-do list:

- aaron rodgers RC
- topps 50th anniversary set
- derek [bestie]

<br />
While arod is pretty much a turd at this point, having his base topps rookie
card has been added to the bucket list. Eventually, I might track said bucket
list here.

With fanatics buying topps and regaining all of the major licenses, topps cards re-cement themselves as my favorite trading card brand. It's iconic, timeless, and the most consistent brand across all trading cards. The 50th anniversary edition then slots nicely into the overall collection.

This guy was definitely not happy with the arod rookie card in this set:

<br />
Then we get to derek [bestie]. He recently gifted me something like 15,000 cards
and I've spent the better part of the last month working my way through them.
He's the GOAT of friends and this is just added to the long list of reasons why.
Anywho, some of his gifts go into the keeper bin and some of them go into the
trader bin. 2005 topps football was a bit of both - leaving me with 305 out of
the 440 card set.

Let the hunt for the rest begin.

After putzing around with a few things, I set off to my favorite mailbox to drop off today's mail. Like for real, it's my favorite mailbox:
![favorite mailbox](/images/optimized/daddy-kane/favorite-mailbox.webp)

<br />I was literally snapping this photo when eeeeeeeemma called for her
mid-day phone call. We chatted a bit about the book I gave her, the anxiety and
depression triggers class she just took, and about her wanting to talk with the
doctor about being released. Doc was currently in the middle of rounds and
eeeeeeeemma was up soon.

She also told me that I'm a pretty chill bro, bro.

<ScrollAmendment>eeeeeeeemma was released to us at 4:30pm.</ScrollAmendment>

<br />
Before we transition to the star of today's show, daddy kane in this context
could be considered daddy(me) and kane(sugar) fitting into this metaphor:
eeeeeeeemma will need some sugar (daddy kane) to help the (figurative) medicine
go down. I'm on the what if prescription drugs weren't the only thing we tried
side of the isle and I will use my all of my alchemist skills to assist
eeeeeeeemma along her journey from here.

This next bit of content was #34 on my overall project board that now sits at 566 total items. 34 is giannis, so I could go on a numerology tangent at any moment. For now though, let's just say it was good to get an old idea off the shelf and placed into production.

A month or two back I spent something like 3-5 hours trying a variety of methods to get this idea off the ground, but it never quite worked and I had to put it away. Then OpenAI released [Sora 2](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/) and I was able to figure it out within minutes. One release to the next was like 100x better than the last. How good will it be 3 or 4 releases from now? It's kinda wild to watch something evolve so quickly.......

Anywho, this is the dumbest thing that I have done yet:

So, every time I hear <i>daddy kane</i> and <i>action bronson</i> comes in with
the line......<i>I peel my face off, it revealed the same face</i>......I laugh.
He's says some of the most ridiculous shit, and this is that fo sho.

<ScrollAmendment>Where'd my glasses go though? Stupid robot.</ScrollAmendment>

<br />
The original idea was just that I wanted to laugh about this and share it with
the right group chat and it evolved into whatever the hell that just was.

I was also today years old when I put together the fact that the album this comes from, <i>the elephant man's bones</i>, by <i>roc marciano</i>, was entirely produced by <i>the alchemist</i>. The same alchemist that showed up yesterday in [mercy](/shaolin/mercy). I didn't remember that until after I started working on it.

Catch me reading from my spellbook and bringing you the will of the gods.

For giggles, here's the full version of <i>daddy kane</i>:

I'm telling you, that cold NYC feel is the perfect backdrop for frankenstein's
monster as he wanders through siberia.

Since big daddy kane popped into the frame, let's have a brief chat about him. He was like 4 years too early for my prime and while I don't have a ton of attachment to his music, most of my legends do. This is my personal favorite:

<br />
Next, let's dabble in the downsides of AI. kane has a new album coming out yet
this year (I think), and he and the rza dropped a new video leading up to it:
<YouTubeVideo id="AIXcvvPifeU" orientation="landscape" />

<br />
<i>open ya eyes</i> itself is a decent song, but damn if they didn't just mail
it in with a generic AI video. I'm sure someone worked very hard to get this
aligned to the music, and yet? Not it. Cap.

Lastly, I pushed a tiny new component into the repo so that I don't have to remember the syntax for having an external link open in a new tab and an internal link open in the same page. Now I just pass the label, a link, and the smarty pants does the rest for me.

I look forward to forgetting this new syntax that helps me avoid having to remember the OG syntax.

<i>LONG LIVE THE DADDY KANE</i>.
