<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" divider={false}>
    Yesterday I decided to incorporate some <i>tcdb</i> functionality into my process and I dropped the [brandon jennings](/shaolin/brandon-jennings) link onto [his page](https://www.tcdb.com/Person.cfm/pid/31175/Brandon-Jennings) on the site. Basically, you can start a forum post by player, team, set, and any number of levels.

    The feature is underutilized at that granular level, so there are a dozen or so cases where I am the only one to have posted on a player or team. With that in mind, I'm probably going to continue to play and slowly take over the forums with my cross platform content.

    It's also a good way to evolve my understanding around some of the functionality within <i>vercel</i>, the server infrastructure I'm running this site off of. As an example, I've got a variety of communities (or social media) that I'll eventually start to leave breadcrumbs in to learn more about referrers.

    ![referrers](/images/optimized/tcdb-smoke-test/referrers.webp)

    That forum post on <i>tcdb</i> got me 18 referrals before it eventually fell off the homepage. First, 18 is pretty good for a first crack, and second, not many people are enthused about <i>brandon jennings</i> so the engagement died on the vine immediately. Still, interesting data point.

    In non-<i>tcdb</i> news, how about Germany and France showing up? One person from each country somehow found the homepage, and my German pal actually read the homepage's instructions. How do I know that? Because I could see the pages they visited and the order they were visited. Kinda fun.

    <ScrollAmendment>Some of you aren't good at following directions. I have the data. lol</ScrollAmendment>

    The accounts.google.com referrals remind me to give a shout out to <i>lulu</i> and <i>donnie</i>, my two most loyal readers. Each has logged into the site with their Google account and both have used the comments feature. BTW <i>lulu</i>, I don't know when I will add the feature that emails me when comments are dropped in chronicles ([asked here](/shaolin/pale-blue-dot)). I also want to add reply functionality so I can tell you both I love you directly where you engage.

    Since we are talking numbers, let's take a detour into looking at how people access the site:

    ![operating systems](/images/optimized/tcdb-smoke-test/os.webp)

    First of all, I wanna know who visited the site from a Linux device. That's pretty hardcore - and I'm pretty sure it's a random hit from the internet somewhere. If it's you, and you have my number, text me. ha

    For you mobile users, know that I basically don't test any of my content on a mobile device because it's just not that serious and that's just enough extra work that I don't do it unless I'm targeting a mobile feature. It's a testament to the skill with which the bot has utilized the appropriate technology to ensure accessibilty on all devices.

    We'll close with a look into the numbers and data I check multiple times a day (like a psychopath):

    ![7 days](/images/optimized/tcdb-smoke-test/7-days.webp)

    Last 7 days have been good.

    ![30 days](/images/optimized/tcdb-smoke-test/30-days.webp)

    Overall, I can pretty much get 100-125 page views without doing a single thing (other than dropping content), and then if I intentionally send out links to various group chats or forums, I can pretty easily clear 200 a week as you see above.

    In the first month or two of the site I was sending out a lot more messages to a lot more people to see just how much engagement I could get by forcing the issue. In the last month or so, I've focused more on how I can goose these numbers simply by adding features or shaping the content in a way that naturally leads to more engagement.

    TL;DR: If you don't click the links like I ask you to, it makes me sad.
