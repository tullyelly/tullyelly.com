    <i>nikkigirl</i> played a bit of a trick on me today and showed up with a surprise guest:

    It hasn't been a bad week per se, just more of a mentally taxing week, and when I say that my attitude flipped on its head, I'm not doing it nearly enough justice.

    We shared a pizza, we laughed, and she had some terribly stinky gas.

    Perfect.

    Before we dip, looks like a Detroit fan showed up at the door, eh?

    Aaron's one of my best Detroit customers. Looks like only our 5th trade......I would have guessed more. I think Aaron's active on the <i>tcdb</i> forum and I might be merging two thoughts unintentionally.

    Couple of quick points on the deal:
    - Shouts to Greg Monroe, he played a sneaky important part on the <i>giannis</i> timeline
    - Topps Chrome is fun, even the unlicensed product
    - I completely forgot that Jeff Garcia played for Detroit

    Never trust your memory.
