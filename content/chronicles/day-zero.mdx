I'll call this day zero because it was really a nothing burger of a first day. Orientation, I feel so safe, diversity, ethics, and all the usual corporate talk. Mostly, bs.

Thankfully, it was a big crew disperced across the country so there was no ice breaker tap dancing required. I'll probably never see any of them again type stuff.

I closed the workday with a 2 hour meeting with the boss man. We went through most of the org chart and I don't even remember my name at this point. I think I put a star next to Dan, and another start next to Steve when I wrote their names down. Obviously important types.

Beyond the tick tock of today, my main issues will revolve around living a real life like a real boy again. What will I do for coffee? Are lunch boxes still a thing? What will I bring to work with me? Do I have enough charging cables or is 20 not going to cut it anymore......that kinda stuff.

Plus, my work issued laptop is a beast.

Oh, and eeeeeeeemma was kind enough to snap this candid photo that ron was then kind enough to photoshop.
