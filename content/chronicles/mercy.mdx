We watched the new frankenstein movie on Netflix last night.

<br />
It's been getting really good buzz and it lived up to the billing. Very
enjoyable.

I'm not sure I've ever watched an entire frankenstein movie prior to this - I've always been more of a dracula guy myself. That said, there's a lot to unpack within this story, particularly around the idea of frankenstein seeking the mercy of death. It just so happens to be something we've thought a lot about 'round these parts lately. lol

Beyond that, there's plenty to chew on: forgiving your father, friendship, purity vs violence, playing god, etc. Visually stunning to boot.

Recommend.

armand hammer (billy woods & euclid) dropped a new album, mercy, this past week and it's been getting steady run since. Entirely produced by the alchemist, it has that cold NYC winter feel that would fit well as the backdrop of a frankenstein movie.

I'm not familiar with their previous works, but they keep popping up here and there on features, and I figured it was time to give them some run. Me likey.

billy woods recently dropped a horror based rap album called golliwog that pops into rotation every now and again so at some point I'll be doing a deep dive all around here.

Really though, this is just an excuse to link to super nintendo. This beat is bananas.

alchemist has been on a crazy run in the past few years. Seems like he drops
something every other week at this point. Bangers aplenty.

Time to get my timbs out, son.

A few different things drifted this week, so I spent a good chunk of today cleaning up the project plan and closing out some lingering work.

The biggest change this week was the installation of analytics tools on the site. Here's what you knuckleheads got up to this week:

I've got a guess who the Mac user is:

If you haven't used the site on a desktop/laptop, give it a shot. Things are
quite a bit different on a screen larger than your phone. The most obvious
places are the menus, <a href="/mark2/shaolin-scrolls">shaolin scrolls</a>, and
<a href="/cardattack/tcdb-rankings">tcdb rankings</a>.

eeeeeeeemma continues to do well. We see her every day and talk at least one more time on the phone. Plus, I won at scrabble today.
