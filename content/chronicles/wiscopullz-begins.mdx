  Spent a good portion of the day sleeping again. Tired, congested, and lazy.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack">
    In between not moving a muscle, I started to sort the boxes of cards I showed [yesterday](/shaolin/ser-dunk) from <i>wiscopullz</i>. First we sort by sets:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="wiscopullz-begins/wiscopullz" />

    Next, get them all (or most) into boxes to help get a sense of how many cards it is:

    ![4000](/images/optimized/wiscopullz-begins/4000.webp)

    That'll be roughly 4000 cards for $50 or slightly over a penny a card. My kind of bulk purchase.

    I tried to start loading stuff into <i>tcdb</i>, starging with some junk wax era basketball:

    ![junk wax](/images/optimized/wiscopullz-begins/junk-wax.webp)

    ......and I ran out of steam after about a dozen cards. lol
