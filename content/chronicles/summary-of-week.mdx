Simple day. Found a pant or two. Took eeeeeeeemma's car into the shop.

We'll let mr.robot do the heavy lifting today. Here's what we've chatted about over the last 7 days.

## 🧠 Technical Development & Site Features

**Blog Enhancements**<br />
You explored adding comments to your blog. We discussed the implementation complexity, likely effort (front-end + backend integration), and options ranging from self-hosted solutions to using APIs like Disqus or Giscus.

**Google Photos Integration**<br />
You investigated embedding a Google Photos album directly on your site. We reviewed available methods ; embed links, free services that provide iframe-friendly galleries, and the option of building your own lightweight viewer using Google Photos API access tokens.

**Playwright & Flaky Tests**<br />
You ran your Playwright e2e suite, dealing with intermittent (“flaky”) failures. Logs showed `.env.test` being injected properly, and the focus was on diagnosing unstable tests ; particularly differences between pointer/touch handling and environmental issues with test setup.

**Quiz Feature Inquiry**<br />
You asked about how much work it would take to add a quiz system to tullyelly.com. We explored potential solutions ; static vs dynamic rendering, client-side logic, and Postgres integration for tracking answers or scores.

## 🧩 Tooling & Workflows

**Kapwing vs DaVinci Resolve**<br />
You compared Kapwing (your current editor) with DaVinci Resolve, weighing ease-of-use, integration with your existing stack, and creative control. DaVinci offers deep color grading and compositing power, but Kapwing remains more seamless for quick, web-based collaborative edits.

**VSCode Snippet Syncing**<br />
We talked about ensuring your custom snippets sync across devices ; covering how VSCode stores them, enabling cloud settings sync, and where to back up snippet files (`User/snippets` directory). The goal was resilience if your current laptop were lost.

## 🪶 Creative & Personal Projects

**Journal Exploration**<br />
You went on a focused search for a new work journal emphasizing:

- Lay-flat design
- High paper quality
- Leather or distinct cover
- Pen holder

<br />
You asked for Amazon-available options, refining across several passes ; from
general inspiration to practical, professional-quality notebooks.

**Household Care Tips**<br />
You checked whether backpacks, lunchboxes, and hats were safe for machine washing ; weighing material safety, pre-soaking, and gentle cleaning alternatives.

## 🧱 Hardware & Home Projects

**Bookshelf Restoration**<br />
You revisited painting a small bookshelf in Bucks colors.
We explored:

- Sanding requirements (removing roughness vs full stripping)
- Paint recommendations for non-sticky, book-safe finishes
- Padding/surface layer ideas
- Cordless orbital sander recommendations (favoring balance of power and cost)

---

## 🧰 Meta & Pattern Continuity

Your ongoing patterns continued:

- Experimenting with naming conventions in the BOX Series (you locked in BOX-THIRTY-EIGHT-MEN-OUT).
- Maintaining a Cream City aesthetic and strong alignment between your creative, technical, and organizational layers.
- Sustaining your broader Shaolin system across Confluence, Jira, and tullyelly.com ; though the week’s focus skewed toward tooling, journaling, and lighter design research rather than schema or build work.

**Threads of Continuity**<br />
Across all topics, there’s a clear rhythm:

- Streamlining tools you already use (Kapwing, Playwright, VSCode).
- Choosing better-quality creative instruments (journals, sander, paint).
- Enhancing tullyelly’s user interaction layer (comments, embeds, quizzes).
- Sustaining your aesthetic and thematic identity across projects.
