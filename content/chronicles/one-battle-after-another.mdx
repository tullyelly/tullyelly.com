No coding today.

I started today by beginning to pull some of the 1000+ cards that will go out in tomorrow's mail while I centered myself for an interview at 9:30. Today's interview was with the hiring manager, his boss, and a few individuals that will interface directly with this role. It was a round robin kind of deal I had to give the here's who I am pitch 3 different times.

That said, it went well. My next, and hopefully last, interview is with the VP at the top of this respective food chain. It's in person, so hopefully they don't mind pony tails.

After that I got back to pulling all of the cards needed for some trades, and then took a nice nap.

When I woke up, I went with Bonnie to see <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/one_battle_after_another" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One Battle After Another</a> and quite enjoyed it. Bonnie was then kind enough to point out the issues with the portrayal of black women, noted <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/29/jezebels-race-kink-and-cardi-b-in-one-battle-after-another-black-women-are-still-stereotypes-paul-thomas-anderson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, and all over <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=one+battle+after+another+black+women+reddit&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1133US1133&oq=one+battle+after+another+black+wome&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgCEEUYOxiABDIGCAAQRRg5Mg4IARBFGCcYOxiABBiKBTIJCAIQRRg7GIAEMgcIAxAAGIAEMg0IBBAAGIYDGIAEGIoFMgcIBRAAGO8FMgoIBhAAGIAEGKIEMgYIBxBFGDzSAQgzNzg4ajBqN6gCCLACAfEFHvIeRARpwxzxBR7yHkQEacMc&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. I'm 100% a part of the problem, because I never would have picked up on this and frankly, I enjoyed the movie all the same.

It's one battle after another against my white priviledge it turns out.

Respect black women is a solid take. Can't argue there.

From there I wrapped up the night with our darling Milwaukee Bucks and the season opening win. They are younger, fresher, probably not as gooder, but gosh darn it, I'm really excited for the season. Last year, I didn't watch every night like I have in the past - even as I didn't have a job or anything to do other than watch sports. We're here for the vibes and the vibes haven't been great for a few years now.

It's vibe szn again though. Bucks in 6!
