Before we get to the meat of it, let's quickly revisit <i>zero</i>, by <i>jean grae & quelle chris</i>. It didn't quite fit the vibe of [mindful practice](/shaolin/mindful-practice), so here we are back at it again.

The official video be fire emoji is the point.

Dopeness.

Did I mention that <i>jean grae & quelle chris</i> are married? Did you know that I've asked jean to marry me? 3 times:

For the record, she was not married at the time. Also for the record, I cannot
escape the problematic white boi red flags that seem to follow us white bois
around. It's almost like there might be something systemic.....

I just checked with the ultimate white boi [fake news], jesus, and he seems the forgiving type so I'm gonna to keep it moving.

Because being a creep on early twitter isn't nearly the worst of it, I repent via hug ball.

Long story short, I added a new component that will append every blog post with a signature block to include hug ball (and a link to its origin story), as well as the title, date, summary, and tags for any given chronicle.

New menu, who dis?
