Yesterday in our weekly team meeting the fellas and I joked about nobody doing any real work the week of xmas, and I let them know they are free to jiggle their mice every few minutes to fit in with the rest of America. Fake work all day, err day.

Well, one of the homies said he was going to write a script for us to do this automagically and next, <i>stealth mouse jiggler</i> was born:

This heroic looking thing looks hella ready to fight crime. Except they've never done anything of the sort their entire life. Sure looks like they do though.

In other news, there was a rash of fires to put out today, most of which were self-inflicted wounds and next, <i>user error</i> was born:

This Sith Lord's sole purpose in life is to show up and provide balance to the incompetance force.

A classic tale of useless good vs useless evil. We've now got a section of our knowledge base devoted to the dumb AI characters we generate while we are supposed to be working. I guess they don't have to pretend to work as long as I show up to make sure they aren't actually working.

Wait, does that make me the <i>stealth mouse jiggler</i>?
