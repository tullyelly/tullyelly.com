Welcome back.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="theabbott">
    Sometimes I've got no good ideas for a post when suddenly an old idea of mine meets a current event and I pull that old idea out of [obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to merge it into that current event (example: [yesterday](/shaolin/saturn)).

    Sometimes I've got no good ideas for a post when suddenly the right song triggers the right reflex to merge something that happened to me that day with said song that triggered the reflex (example: [today](/shaolin/4th-dimension)). That song today?

    <YouTubeVideo id="6Hj5tucYv1Q" orientation="landscape" />

    So here's the thing: I can't quit <i>kanye</i> and the sampling on this song is the one reason why. And I'm pretty sure I never will quit him - basically for anything. Pair <i>kid cudi</i> with <i>mr. west</i>? Well then we've got a lifelong love affair, no matter what mental illnesses present. In either the artist in question or myself. lol

    Now add in that it's possible I've never been more aligned on any single thing with <i>bonnibel</i> than the <i>kanye</i> albums that we can't shut up about. This [kids see ghosts](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tVP1zc0TDPNyksvqMg1YPTiz85MKVYoTk1VSM_ILy4pBgCmPgq4&q=kids+see+ghosts&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1133US1133&oq=kids+see&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggBEC4YsQMYgAQyDQgAEAAY4wIYsQMYgAQyCggBEC4YsQMYgAQyBggCEEUYOTIHCAMQABiABDIHCAQQABiABDIHCAUQABiABDIHCAYQABiABDIHCAcQABiABDIHCAgQABiABDIHCAkQABiABNIBCDI4NDhqMGo3qAIIsAIB8QVOsItEmM9soA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) album being one of them. I bet I text her twice a year just to be like, <i>kids see ghosts</i> fucking slaps.

    Perhaps you would like to season this take of mine with the fact that even <i>lulu</i> has a deep batch of shared history with me and a few <i>ye</i> albums - not necessarily the same ones as <i>bonnibel</i> either. Truth be told, <i>yeezy</i> was the soundtrack to wide swaths of me growing a dad bod; especially the years that I was a single dad. Hip hop and my kids = peanut butter & jelly.

    Hell, even he gets what he's putting me through:

    Anywho, I was curious so I went and searched the group chats and found this:

    This FRENZ chat is one of my favorite things ever. Another story for another time tho.

    Shout out to <i>dr. uncle ryan</i>.

    Next item up for bid? The story that grew from a song's spark.

    Quite randomly, Thursday's ended up being one of the more taxing days of the week for me because I have 3 of my 6 direct report 1:1s. Few things drain me like having to be a leader. Few things are more guaranteed in my life than me being a leader.

    I hate what I love.

    Anywho, 1 of the 6 has pretty consistently lagged behind the others in a variety of ways, and there were a few glaring examples in the last week that basically forced me to force the issue. Every single person that ever reports to me is presented with a steep learning curve. I don't operate, think, or lead in ways that you'll often encounter, so I know that I can contribute to people stumbling because they are literally trying to get their [sea legs](https://youtu.be/rONyX2-nQ5A?si=d7Pv38UfeD7XN2yF) with me.

    <ScrollAmendment>This isn't to say that I'm better or worse than the next leader (you dear reader), only different. Believe in yourself.</ScrollAmendment>

    Now, I love this gentleman. He's got a fantastic familial origin story that I'd love to learn more about, and I actually do not have any deep seeded long term concerns with him. A portion of this serves to highlight the skill and talent with the other 5 fellas as well. He's part of a strong team.

    He's also got the least amount of experience on my team and today it dawned on me; he's never been held to a high standard before. Not like this.

    Today, I continued to show someone living in 3D, the [4th dimension](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPhysics/comments/cfuiyz/what_is_the_fourth_dimension/).
