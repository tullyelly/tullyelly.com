nikkigirl and I made our way out to Hortonville tonight and attended the xmas party for my division. A couple of my people made the trek from southern Wisconsin up for the party and it was the first time I have met them in person. Good people.

As with most parties that I attend, my anxiety pre-party was off the charts, but once I am in the mix, I end up being a pretty good party pal. nikkigirl tells me that I'm like a whole new boy, putting myself out there like never before.

Still hate it. lol

Check out this fancy little fella that one of my peeps 3D printed for me:

He's been 3D printing these and handing them out for a while now. We call him, missle toad.
