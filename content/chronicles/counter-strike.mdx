The same day I received my first offer letter, I also had another company reach out to explore a different job opportunity with me. The new organization's advertised pay package was larger than the leader in the clubhouse and it was well timed. This new opportunity added a bullet in the chamber and helped me feel more comfortable in my negotiation position.

Counter-strike in process.

I've been fighting the bot and the menu system, specifically, the touch screen interface on a desktop. I'm working to build the app to function across all devices it is likely to encounter, so there's mobile, desktop, keyboard jockeys, larger tablets or touch enabled laptops.......and it's annoying me. I can all but guarantee I'm chasing something only I'll even know is a thing - so it's time to put that to bed for now.

Logged as a bug, fly away for now bug.

Instead I've implemented improvements to:

- Dialog widths adapting appropriately to all screen sizes
  - Testing was flaky so go away picky tests. Logged for later.
  - I did fix a few other tests that regressed, so both sides of my mouth, ya dig?
- Wiped out the lingering deploy to production menu bugs.
  - Got sick of a test and deleted it. I'm done over-testing.
- Created some separation between breadcrumbs and chronicles
- Fixed chronicles pagination
- Updated numbered pagination colors/styling

I dropped a box of cards today. 200-300 cards all over the place. Can't remember a catastrophe this big in a long time. Good thing I'm a psychopath and I sleeve every card - so catastrophe is hyperbole.

Bucks are currently up on the Warriors - without Giannis. Somebody come save me from myself. It's championship or bust!!! Bucks in six.

Hug ball.
