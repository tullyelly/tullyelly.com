    Right back into 2019-20 basketball, staring with a few rando sets, flowing into [2019-20 Panini Mosaic](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewSet.cfm/sid/227998/2019-20-Panini-Mosaic), and closing with some other randos. This is a fun <i>giannis</i> journey:

    This [2019-20 Panini Impeccable - Gold #100 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/228095/cid/14373059/2019-20-Panini-Impeccable---Gold-100-Giannis-Antetokounmpo) is numbered to /49, and is another card that's not terribly exciting, except for the fact that there's only 49 of them floating in the ether.

    Here we have [2019-20 Panini Instant NBA #183 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/225911/cid/15089968/2019-20-Panini-Instant-NBA-183-Giannis-Antetokounmpo), which has a print run of 157. PRs are similar to numbered cards, but in this case they don't individually serialize the cards. There's 157 of them and it doesn't indicate which of the 157 it is.

    Anywho, this 2019-20 <i>milwaukee bucks</i> team is my favorite team of all time (me thinks). A few reasons:
    - <i>giannis</i> won both the MVP and Defensive Player of the Year
    - All things considered, I think this is the best <i>giannis</i> team
    - We were still on the up arrow portion of the journey

    Next item up for bid is [2019-20 Panini Mosaic - Camo Pink #75 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/232168/cid/14568431/2019-20-Panini-Mosaic---Camo-Pink-75-Giannis-Antetokounmpo), and this one's claim to fame is it's graded. A PSA 10 grade is basically the highest valued version of a card that you can have. I've never actually sent a card in for grading; instead, I'm a bottom feeder for PSA 10s. If I see a low end 10 for cheap, I'll probably snag it (think $20-40).

    This particular card was purchased very early on after I got back into cards, and let me tell you what, I didn't make money on this one (lol). It has a pop count of 628, which means cert: #[48947289](https://www.psacard.com/cert/48947289/psa) has 627 other friends out there also graded a 10 (scale is 1 to 10). That's on the high end for pop count - the lower the number the better, just like it is for serial numbers, and print runs.

    As noted, this is [2019-20 Panini Mosaic - Camo-Pink](https://www.tcdb.com/Checklist.cfm/sid/232168/2019-20-Panini-Mosaic---Camo-Pink) is an oldy but a goodie. This Camo Pink set was one of <i>eeeeeeeemma</i>'s favorite sets when she dabbled with cards, so I'm actively trying to complete it. Not a high priority, and yet, a bucket list item all the same.

    Currently, I have 100 of 300 total.

    Speaking of <i>eeeeeeeemma</i>, I wonder how she's doing in [mexico](/shaolin/mexico)?

    [Take off, hoser](/shaolin/strange-brew)! I think she's doing just fine, eh?
