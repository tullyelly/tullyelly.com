    The first set against UNION B17 Black was a pretty close match throughout, only to see it slip away in the end, 19-25. 0-1.

    Next set we got out to a 16-12 lead followed by a tie at 18, a four point deficit 18-22, another tie at 22 & 24, just to watch them take the last two points 24-26.

    0-2. Game, set, match (bad guys).

    Next villain to slay: OPVC 17 Purple. Once again, we jumped out to a lead, this time 8-4, just to get run pretty good, 17-25. 0-1.

    The second set made it to a tie at 11, a four point deficit at 14-18, extended to 5 at 16-21, cut to 3 at 20-23, one at 23-24, and we ran out of gas again, 24-26. Bummer. 0-2.

    Game, set, match (bad guys).

    Our boi <i>jeff-meff</i> got some good action across both sets of this match:
