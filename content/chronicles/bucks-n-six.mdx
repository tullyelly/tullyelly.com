<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" releaseId="97">
    The real fun when visiting [card & coin](/shaolin/card-and-coin) are the baskeball BOGO envelops. They are loading with late 90's to the early 10's NBA cards and that's a bit of a dark time for the hobby, especially with basketball. Any early 90's or more modern cards are everywhere. Both eras are considered to be [junk wax](https://share.google/aimode/PL4jR0lrFeppvTPej), so anything inside that junk wax sandwich, like these BOGO cards, are a bit harder to find.

    The past few days I've been chipping away at 300 some of these cards and came across a decent batch of <i>bucks</i> cards that we'll dive into.

    ......record scratch......you are probably wondering how I got here. Well, I'm an idiot, and when I was getting ready for work today, I proved it.

    Back to the program:

    ![flotsam & jetsam](/images/optimized/bucks-n-six/flotsam.webp)

    Nothing much to write home about, but I guess I'll write at home about it anyways. All <i>bucks</i> cards are loved. RIP <i>tractor traylor</i>.

    ![ascension](/images/optimized/bucks-n-six/ascension.webp)

    <i>card & coin</i> has so many of these Ascension cards, it's not even funny. That, and Tyler Herro rookie cards.

    ![rookies](/images/optimized/bucks-n-six/rookies.webp)

    I definintely talked myself into these guys for years at a time.

    ![they were robbed](/images/optimized/bucks-n-six/robbed.webp)

    This is the cream city cream of this crop. These four superheroes will get their own pages one of these days. The 2000-01 <i>bucks</i> team could be argued as my favorite team ever. So many memories tied up in this team. Plus, they were robbed. <i>they were robbed</i> is what the that corner of my collection is called.

    Robbed, I'm telling you.

    ![leaderboard](/images/optimized/bucks-n-six/leaderboard.webp)

    After all of that, here's the leaderboard and my count against unique <i>milwaukee bucks</i> cards. Guess what though, every single one of the cards shown here was a double. Cuz, like, I have a lot of them.

    Let the hunt continue.
