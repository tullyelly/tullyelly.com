    We need to pause your regularly scheduled program to directly address the most important person in the whole wide world, <i>lulu</i>. She has threatened to never read my blog again unless I interact with her comments. Here we go:

    Why yes, my sweet daughter. This is all your fault. I try to do my best to never hold a grudge, and yet, you might be the exception to the rule. Thanks for nothing.

    ![fans](/images/optimized/lulu-demands/fans.webp)

    I've been meaning to do a few things with comments:

    - Trigger an email to me when someone comments
    - Add the ability to reply to comments
    - Automatically delete your comments before anything else happens

    Alas, nobody is perfect. Even the dad you never really had. I hope that you will learn from my mistakes and that you never live to see your child disappointed in you the way you are with me today.

    Oh, the shame.
