While my back is much better today, it wasn't well enough to hop into a go-kart. Bummer.

Anywho, we stopped by [midwest super speedway](https://midwestsuperspeedway.com/) for some racing, and here's the healthy grid:

They ran 5 Heats and by the end of it they had a pretty good feel for the course.

In the end, p-funk was the most consistent with 3 heat wins, while quinn ended up pulling out the fastest time overall in his 2 wins. mr. meff even managed to close the gap to the big boys in the final heat that was the most competive of them all.

quinn and p-funk had the 2nd and 3rd fastest laps of the entire day when we left. They were both consistently the fastest two racers on the course during our stay.

i obviously could have beaten them both had I not been so washed.
