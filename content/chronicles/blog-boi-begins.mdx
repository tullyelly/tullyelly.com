Yesterday, I had planned on the full rollout of v2.5.0 - to include sharing it with at good 2 dozen or so peeps, only to stumble on the menu system. When I deployed from development into production, everything worked exactly as intended.....except the menu system. In frustration, I quit the week.

Today, I woke up and Jira was down. Normally not the end of the world, but on a Monday I close out last week's work and then begin next week's work so my string of bad luck seemed to follow me into the new week.

While Jira was down I got back into trying to figure out why the menu system wasn't working like it appeared it should be. First, we (robots and I) explored issues with the database. Nope, not it. Next, was there an issue with the code itself? Duh, obviously. Finally, after adding a few logs to production and turning off caching across the site, it was revealed to be a caching issue. Johnny Cache strikes again.

Long story short, caching was resolved and the menus system now works in production.

Because my plans were thrwarted by the gods, I've decided to continue working on a few more minor issues before I really launch the app to the masses. It's mostly under the covers type stuff that will really only matter to me. Not much in the way of programming today folks.

Instead, I played with my toys! More to come on this, and much much more beyond.

One love.

jeff meff had his last volleyball game tonight. He and the bois won both sets handily before giving way to the backups closing the last set. What follows is me trying to learn this markdown language and embed some images from the match.

Here's mr. meff with a block attempt
