Things got a bit hairy today with someone on my team and I spent a decent batch of time over the last two days putting out fires. I'm officially locked in, and low-key, useful.

That said, it's been an emotional week, and more specifically Friday, so this will be a short one.

I'll say this though: I've been living life at my own pace for a long time and I've managed to hitch my wagon to a rocket ship. The width and breadth of this beast is breathtaking.

This is gonna be a ton of fun.
