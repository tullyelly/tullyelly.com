    I picked up the 90's junk wax where I left it [yesterday](/shaolin/wiscopullz-begins), and these were the first three cards I loaded:

    ![1991-92 Upper Deck](/images/optimized/randomness/upper-deck.webp)

    At first blush, other than the fact they are all All-Star related cards, there's absolutely nothing special about these cards. Prior to today I had 447 cards out of the 500 card complete set; which means there was an 89.4% chance I would already have these bad boys. Nope! I added all three to bring me to 450/500.

    I enjoy random moments like that.

    I rarely know what I will blog about more than a few minutes before I do. My job makes it almost entirely impossible to predict any given day. I can promise you my friends & family keep me on my toes. All of that to say, it's a good thing that I like the randomness of any given day.

    Now, if you'll indulge me for a moment as we get back to the cards - these were All-Star cards, and Hall of Famers and All-Star cards make up the bulk of the last 50 cards I need to complete the set. Combine that with the fact that <i>wiscopullz</i> is much more likely to acquire the kinds of cards I need to complete the set, and that probability matrix starts to tip towards it not being quite THAT random. But still, let's not ruin the fun with math.

    On the flipside, too much random and I start to have a panic attack. I must control something inside the world's chaos engine.

    Because I was stupid enough to get a job, all of my best laid plans with regards to the never ending battle against organizing thousands of cards has devolved into an absolute disaster.

    I credit <i>derek</i> with making it worse. His boundless energy has pulled me back into cards and adding thousands of them into 15 unfishished ideas is driving me a bit batty.

    Time to consolidate, redistribute, and consider next best steps.

    ---

    First consolidation: BOX-FORTY-FORTY-CLUB. This box now holds roughly 900 baseball cards that need to be loaded into <i>tcdb</i>, ranging from the 1960s all the way up through today. Key contributions here:
    - <i>derek</i>
    - <i>card & coin</i>
    - <i>wiscopullz</i>

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="randomness/22-twos" />

    The box itself was first made to hold 2022-23 basketball cards before that idea fell apart. Truth be told though, the first idea ended up turning into the release schedule on [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls), so we here at tullyelly.com will embrace the randomness of a box made for basketball currently holding vintage baseball.

---

We'll just quickly rip through the rest of what I sorted and consolidated today:

- Football: Roughly 4000 cards to load
- Baseketball: Another 4000 or so
- Hockey: 200 ish
- Wrestling: 100+
- Other stuff: 400 something remain

And with that, there's the next 6 months of loading cards redistributed into a coherent thought.

As part of the cleanup, I came across a nice batch of <i>bucks-n-six</i> cards from the [last card show](/shaolin/derek):

That <i>jabari</i> is pretty sick. Next up:

![numbered](/images/optimized/randomness/numbered.webp)

All of these are numbered and just a little bit of extra fun. Those are my first two Topps Chrome cards of the year as well. Finally:

![freaky](/images/optimized/randomness/freak.webp)

Always good to see this beautiful face show up. Phew; we made it past the trade deadline one mroe time at least.

  I had to turn trading back on to allow for one trading partner to counter a large offer, and during that open window, Rusty snuck a deal in. It was a no brainer, and I owe him one. Here's the sole card I am sending out:

![rustypetty](/images/optimized/randomness/rusty.webp)

This is our 16th deal together.

  Because I was going to be pulling cards this weekend, I opened up Dennis' want list and found a deal to be made:

![utah jazz](/images/optimized/randomness/utah.webp)

Dennis is my primary Utah Jazz correspondent, and this [2024-25 Panini Totally Certified - Mirror Blue Platinum #118 Jordan Clarkson](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/500271/cid/28329445/2024-25-Panini-Totally-Certified---Mirror-Blue-Platinum-118-Jordan-Clarkson) is numbered to /99. I bet something cool is coming back in return!

This is our 12th deal together.

  Let's squeeze another old favorite into Super Bowl Sunday trade day:

<FolderImageCarousel folder="randomness/970598" />

While Kerry is my #1 Trailblazer correspondent, I wasn't aware (or maybe I forgot) that they were also an Eagles fan. Always a fun trading partner.

Unfortunately, I also couldn't find two cards in the deal so I had to scramble:

![mistakes were made](/images/optimized/randomness/mistakes.webp)

I added these two to replace those I couldn't find. Hopefully, we've built up enough goodwill over the years.

This is our 12th deal together.

  PS......I ran the ink dry on a pen today. Exciting news:

![pen](/images/optimized/randomness/pen.webp)

I got that beauty on a work related field trip.

Fun game to play tomorrow: listen for the [dog
whistle](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_whistle_(politics)>) that is people
complaining about the Super Bowl halftime show.
