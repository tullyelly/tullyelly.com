Happy Birthday <i>bonnibel</i>! Prepare yourself for some birthday uppies:

<LoopedGIF src="/videos/bonnibel/uppies.webp" alt="birthday uppies" />

As part of her birthday celebration, I've augmented the [squad](/unclejimmy/squad) page to change her link so that it points to another newly created part of the site. Checkout [bonnibel's](/unclejimmy/squad/bonnibel) newly created page for more content relating to her!

I've got big plans for the [squad](/unclejimmy/squad) section of the site in 2026. It'll be interesting to see where the [vibe coding](/shaolin/vibe-coding) takes us and if it even remotely resembles the original idea.

Besides the birthday girl getting first dibs on a new portion of the site, I also added a few more minor improvements:

- The [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) table was updated to give the "Release Name" column maximum real estate (desktop browser only)
- A view all link was added to the Blog Boi card
- Another view all link was added to the Chronicles Tags [GOAT] card

The first update was brought to you by my OCD and hatred of unintended table wrapping, and the last two are brought to you by <i>nikkigirl</i> providing some good feedback.

Each little bit helps to improve the engagement numbers I'm seeing daily, and I find it fun to see how one improvement to the next drives user behavior. You are my side science experiment.

Iterate.

Before we go, how about one more shout out to the birthday girl!?!? She, along with <i>jeff meff</i>, provided me one of my fondest memories of 2025. IFKYK:

One more, then we peace out. If you haven't read my last [love letter](/shaolin/firsts) to <i>bonnibel</i>, here's another chance.

Happy birthday young lady.
