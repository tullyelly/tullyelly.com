<ReleaseSection alterEgo="tullyelly" releaseId="112">
    <i>nikkigirl</i> has started to actually read my chronicles, and now quite helpfully, is starting to report bugs. Beyond that, I haven't done a great job of testing on mobile and optimizing to address this form factor.

    Anywho, long story short: I removed the small black border around the mobile version of the blog to allow for the content to use more of the mobile viewpoint. Everything breathes a bit better on mobile now, particularly when a "ReleaseSection" has a border to highlight planned releases, bug fixes, <i>tcdb</i> trades or otherwise. No more borders, on borders, on borders.

    I've got a few areas to address still, a few of which center around photos. <i>donnie</i> was the first to report an issue with the image carousel in the comments a while ago.

    A few other cosmetic bug fixes were included in this release:
    - The <i>tcdb</i> trade border didn't always show up on mobile
    - The shaolin scrolls release schedule section sometimes covered up text
    - One typo

    Iterate.
