    <i>timothée chalamet</i> is growing on me, <i>jeff</i>'s favorite person in the world, <i>tyler the creator</i>, costars, and <i>bonnibel</i> stays hooking us up with free movies. A champion of the people.

    I asked each for a blurb on the movie, <i>bonnie</i>'s first:

    <i>
    Marty Supreme is about a man who is a bad friend at best and a conman at worst. He's willing to sacrifice everything, even his dignity, to achieve his dream of being the best Table Tennis player. Only to end up doing one of the only things claims he refuses to do.

    Settle down.

    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

    How about you mr. <i>meff</i>?

    <i>
    Marty supreme is a movie. where a professional ping pong player gets in to crazy shenanigans with his friends and extras. Most of the movie he is a bad friend to Tyler the creator while denying he has a baby then he goes to japan.

    The End
    </i>
    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

    How could I possibly top that? You heard it here first folks, Marty Supreme: 4.5 stars.
