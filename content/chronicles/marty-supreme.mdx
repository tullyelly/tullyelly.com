    Started the day with an early 9:40am showing of [Marty Supreme](https://share.google/ZArZddRZxPAPzmQ1b) with <i>bonnibel</i> and <i>jeff-meff</i>:

    ![marty supreme](/images/optimized/marty-supreme/marty-supreme.webp)

    <i>timothée chalamet</i> is growing on me, <i>jeff</i>'s favorite person in the world, <i>tyler the creator</i>, costars, and <i>bonnibel</i> stays hooking us up with free movies. A champion of the people.

    I asked each for a blurb on the movie, <i>bonnie</i>'s first:

    <i>
    Marty Supreme is about a man who is a bad friend at best and a conman at worst. He's willing to sacrifice everything, even his dignity, to achieve his dream of being the best Table Tennis player. Only to end up doing one of the only things claims he refuses to do.

    Settle down.
    </i>
    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

    How about you mr. <i>meff</i>?

    <i>
    Marty supreme is a movie. where a professional ping pong player gets in to crazy shenanigans with his friends and extras. Most of the movie he is a bad friend to Tyler the creator while denying he has a baby then he goes to japan.

    The End
    </i>
    ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

    How could I possibly top that? You heard it here first folks, Marty Supreme: 4.5 stars.

    Today's card adventure includes putting away some cards that I got for xmas that <i>nikkigirl</i> ripped for me yesterday. She likes to rip the cards, so she gets to rip the cards.

    First up, [2024-25 Hoops](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewSet.cfm/sid/467815/2024-25-Hoops). Hoops is an entry level set, heavy on base cards, and light on anything too thrilling, especially with the blaster that we ripped. Still, we landed two <i>wemby</i>'s:

    ![wemby](/images/optimized/marty-supreme/wemby.webp)

    On the left is [2024-25 Hoops - Frequent Flyers #10 Victor Wembanyama](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/492182/cid/27916123/2024-25-Hoops---Frequent-Flyers-10-Victor-Wembanyama), and on the right is [2024-25 Hoops - Skyview Holo #16 Victor Wembanyama](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/492211/cid/27915546/2024-25-Hoops---Skyview-Holo-16-Victor-Wembanyama). The holo one is pretty fun.

    <i>wemby</i> is an absolute brain bender. He's so fucking tall and posesses little guy skills......no hyperbole, he does things with a basketball that have never been done by another human being in history.

    I've got a few really nice <i>wemby</i> rookies around here somewhere.

    Before we leave Hoops, we pulled an auto!

    ![autograph](/images/optimized/marty-supreme/autograph.webp)

    Autographs in blaster boxes are quite rare. It's a universal rule: if you pull an auto out of a blaster, you won, even it is this [2024-25 Hoops - Great SIGnificance #GS-JCW Justin Champagnie](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/493300/cid/28282602/2024-25-Hoops---Great-SIGnificance-GS-JCW-Justin-Champagnie). Well, winning is pushing the definition of winning in this case.

    Logging the W anyway.

    Next mega up for bid? [2024-25 Panini Select](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewSet.cfm/sid/518078/2024-25-Panini-Select). Panini Select is somewhere in the upper middle range in terms of coolness, and usually has a few fun cards that pop out. Today's winner:

    ![lebron green](/images/optimized/marty-supreme/lebron-green.webp)

    This [2024-25 Panini Select - Hot Stars Green Prizms #8 LeBron James](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/538327/cid/30413905/2024-25-Panini-Select---Hot-Stars-Green-Prizms-8-LeBron-James) is probably the best card out of the holiday bunch. I hope <i>lulu</i> likes it.

    This wrapper is another new color inspired by Topps Chrome. Topps Chrome is lit bro.

    If you hover over the link or hashtag, there's even a cool shimmer that happens. This Topps Chrome wrapper shows up for "wax" (when we rip packs) releases like this one.
