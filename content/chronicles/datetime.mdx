    With <i>nikkigirl</i> gone for most of the night, it's a good time to throw on the new <i>miles davis</i> album that just dropped. 2 hours and 6 minutes of jazz is exactly what I need right now. I'm not enough of a jazz head to know anything about the album, but I've never let ignorance stop me before, so why would I start now?

    I'll link where the album takes me in a playlist below.

    I haven't written about work much lately, partially because I bricked the server, but I guess partially because the mood has not struck. Even though I really want to go play <i>minecraft</i> instead, I'm going to kick the evening off with some light work chat to go with the smooth jazz.

    Yesterday was a very rough day at work and I left flat out angry. NOTHING will light my slow fuse quite like habitual complainers. Now, don't get me wrong, I get sucked into the same negativity vortex as the rest of you, but if you are one of those individuals who enjoys sinking there? Over and over and over and over? I've got zero use for you.

    Pro tip: not everything is the end of the world.

    Pretend wisdom: there's always a middle ground.

    On the plus side, people will tell me some wild shit about their co-workers, and I don't even have to finesse it out of them. As that knowledge based compound interest continues to build and payoff, typically, I end up playing chess right alongside of those checkers-playin-ass-whiners.

    See ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!

    My closest peer is fantastic though. He's the only person I tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth to. Exaggeration and hyperbole aside, he's just awesome. Having a Corporate America bestie is critical to keeping this loose grasp I have on sanity.

    Net positive. Even when I'm furious.

    I turned trading back on over at <i>tcdb</i> as well. I'm going to try and eek out a trade or two a week now that a bit of a routine is starting to settle in. We'll see how successful that is though. I tend to accumulate a ton of offers and it's hard to say no to cards in the mail.

    <i>usps</i> 4 lyfe.

    Oops, I just checked and there are 3 deals in motion already.

    First of all, my dev environment is bonkers fast compared to before I hit [reboot](/shaolin/reboot) yesterday. Turns out, good things can still happen after I've cursed out [my computer](/mark2) for a few hours.

    Next up, I re-fixed the thing I was trying to fix when I bricked said environment on Saturday. After creating a command to generate that day's chronicle template, I noticed that depending on when I created the chronicle, it would populate with today's date, and it also might generate with tomorrow's date.

    UTC management is lamesauce is my point.
