I dapped up ol' dirty bastard's oldest brother, ramsey, last night in Milwaukee while attending the 30th anniversary tour for Liquid Swords (by myself). ramsey is the drummer in the phunky nomads band that is touring along side gza and was gracious enough to spend time with the fans after the show. Dapping ensued.

Last night was also the 21st anniversary of odb's death.

The concert itself was mid. gza always has this look of boredom when he performs and the rave has never really done it for me. The sound system and venue are not very good at handling loud rap - which has always left me feeling a bit wanting.

That said, I was basically in the first row, right behind a 9 or 10 year old kid, a mom who was nice enough to have her boobies out, and her 15 year old son who was a superfan. That meant gza spent a good deal of time rapping directly at us and interacting with my general area throughout the concert.

He ended up signing 4 wu-tang related pieces of vinyl the 15 year old brought
and gave the kid a few different things, including autographs. I'd give gza
himself a solid grade.

Here's the [google album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/2boBL5qT8YsMbWds9) with everything I took.

Oh! And there was no merch at all. I was looking forward to buying something and.....it wasn't meant to be.

As for the album itself, it is basically [unimpeachable](https://www.passionweiss.com/2025/11/08/liquid-swords-gza-genius-wu-tang/). When that intro starts and the little girl begins:

<i>
  when i was little,
  <br />
  my father was famous,
  <br />
  he was the greatest samurai......
  <br />
</i>

Spine-tingle, mind boggles.

To close it off, while it's difficult to put anything over the title track or shadowboxin' with method man, 4th chamber is my favorite song off the album.

<i>So, come boy. Choose life or death</i>:

I used to have a goal of knowing every verse the rza had in the entirety of his catalog and had a journal where I would transcribe all of his verses, as well as practice my memorization against. I would study this shit. Every day.

Nerd alert.

I vididly remember writing this lyric down. Almost as if it was the first time I did so.

Overall, this was a worthy way to spend one of my last nights as a free man. I start the new gig on Monday.
