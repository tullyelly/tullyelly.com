<ReleaseSection alterEgo="mark2" releaseId="86">
  Deltron 3030 has been looping since dawn and it matches the vibe of wiring new features into the Shaolin scrolls. The release tab above now pulls in metadata for scroll 86 so the border and label line up with the source of truth instead of handwritten notes. Seeing the container pick up the color from the release type makes it feel like the page is reacting in real time.

The work today was simple; get the plumbing right and keep the surface calm. The alter ego badge still hangs out in the corner while the tab tells you which release owns the section. No extra styling yet; just honest data flowing through.

  I also queued up a few Deltron deep cuts for the late night pass through the
  backlog. The playlist shifts between heavy synths and sleepy horns; the
  changelog will probably do the same.
