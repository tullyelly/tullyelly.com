  Hey, see that new border around this? That's a fun little feature I added to tickle me, and me alone. Well, perhaps I'll allow it to tickle you as well. Should you insist.

Anywho, I've gotten back into a pretty good rhythm with releases on the [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) release schedule and now when I discuss releases inside of a chronicle, I can flag that section with the appropriate release unlocking the following:

- Colored border to match the color of the release type
- Full release name of the flagged scroll
- Clickable link to more detail (as discussed in [alter ego](/shaolin/alter-ego))

Basically, if any given section of a chronicle has a border 100% around it, that's a blurb about something that I released that day (typically).

Click the release link! Indulge me.

Iterate.

  I also spent a good portion of my day on a Team's call with a colleague that was struggling with his confidence a bit. Sometimes you can be so deep into the weeds that you can't really appreciate what a great job you might be doing. And/or the feedback from those around you can make it difficult to notice that you are on the right path. He's one of my favorite co-workers and I helped him see that he's doing a hell of a good job, and to trust his gut.

Plus, he's sharp as a whip on the technical side, so just seeing what he's been working on gave me all kinds of good ideas. If I were to guess, he feels like he got more out of the exchange than I did, and if I was right in that guess, I would disagree with his assessment.

Great session.

  Next item up for bid? How about a small release I did for <i>cardattack</i>? And by release, I mean I logged about 150+ cards into <i>tcdb</i>; specifically basketball cards from the 2023-2025 range. Nothing too crazy, and mostly base, though I did find this autograph in the box I was storing them in while they waited to get sorted and logged:

![james autograph](/images/optimized/deltron-3030/james-auto.webp)

This one stays in my PC (personal collection) because I'm a narcissist and hoard anyone that shares a name with me. The odds are good, that you, dear reader, also have a section of cards dedicated to you. One day they might even show up at your doorstep if you play your......[clears throat]......cards right.

  Let's close with a little bit of story time......

I was on TikTok today - even though it's bad for me and I try to avoid social media - and someone reminded me of the group <i>deltron 3030</i> [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deltron_3030#:~:text=Deltron%203030%20is%20an%20American,(as%20Skiznod%20the%20Boy%20Wonder).">wikipedia</a>] when talking about <i>dan the automator</i>. As any good fan boi would do, I dropped their self-titled debut album into the queue and gave it a spin.

It's a fantastic, and futuristic journey through time & space.

Anywho, back when <i>nikkigirl</i> and I were divorded, she once called me the Mastermind. Not necessarily in a derogatory way, but not necessarily in a nice way either (lol). I was reminded of this when this popped on the ol' earbuds:

<div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
  <iframe
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O7dyli_nXn4?si=LEjLkHSTEMZzl8aa"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

Around the same time she said that, was one of the times I took one of those personality tests and rated out as an INTJ [[the Mastermind](https://mypersonality.net/personality-type/intj)]. I've taken a wide variety personality style tests over the years, usually within Corporate America, and while many of the results tend to vary slightly the more you take them, I always land as an INTJ when taking Myers-Briggs Type Indicator tests.

If you add this, to that, you get me setting this as <i>nikkigirl</i>'s ringtone on whatever shit phone I had at the time. Remember those? Yeah, this was a ringtone story.

As part of this adventure down memory lane, I found an old email between her and I from over 15 years ago. We shared a nice memory and smile as she read it.

I should probably wish you a happy new year, but I'm a bit of an arbitrary date Grinch. Arbitrary dates stay being arbitrary.
