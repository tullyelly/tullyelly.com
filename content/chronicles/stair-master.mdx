I learned a few more things today.

First, systems are a bit chaotic. 6 or 7 different systems all springing up at roughly the same time, with this hand struggling to figure out what that hand is doing. Not unusual for these early stages, and also ripe with opportunity.

Next, I learned that my daily excersize when I am onsite will be the stairs. I'm on the 2nd floor and walking up to the 8th floor and back down is enough to get my heart rate jumping a little bit. 3 or 4 times a day won't be hard to find time for. Plus, the desks are all standing, and quite nice. Should help keep my on my feet in general. (also looking at buying a standing desk for home)

Lastly, I met with 3/7 of my team today - more formally. We've got an almost superstar athlete who's dreams were crushed by injury. We've got a nerd's nerd who graduated from lakeland university just like me. Go muskies! Last we've got a karaoke superstar who's also a 3d printing expert that is a part-time DJ for the over 55 crowd.

All of us connected well. We'll have some fun together fo sho.
