    It's 2:53am and here I am typing away. I've come down with a bit of a cold, can't sleep, and rather than toss and turn in bed, down I head to the man cave. <i>nikkigirl</i> needs her rest more than I need my comfort.

    I'll probably catch a few more zzz's before work, but maybe not. Might be a long day today.

    Mail day! Few things exceed the joy of mail day. I used to received dozens of goodies a week and now I give up after less than 10 trades because I'm overwhelmed. lol

    Let's take a look at the packaging and <i>marvel</i> cards in this deal:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="3am/964402" />

    That <i>dr. strange</i> low-key slaps.

    When <i>mcjesus</i> makes an appearance we always have fun:

    While I'm a super duper casual when it comes to Hockey, I've started to do more than just follow the highlights again and I'm getting excited for the playoffs. Playoff Hockey + <i>mcjesus</i> = oh boy.

    I ❤️ <i>mcjesus</i>.

    As I was formatting and writing the last section, the AI bot was off on the side developing the next bit of <i>tcdb</i> functionality. I couldn't move near the speed I do now without my support companions.

    Anywho, I(or it) created a way to pass a <i>tcdb</i> trade ID into a route to show the front and back end of any given deal, to include links back to the original chronicle posts. Check out the first example [here](/cardattack/tcdb-trade/964402).

    From now on, when I leave [feedback](https://www.tcdb.com/MemberFeedback.cfm/Toddbwd#Feedback) on <i>tcdb</i>, I'll also include a link back to the deal on the site. That'll boost engagement a tiny bit and I look forward to seeing how much it registers on the analytics page.

    One of my favorite recent releases.

    Iterate.
