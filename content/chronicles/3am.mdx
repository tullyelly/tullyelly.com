    It's 2:53am and here I am typing away. I've come down with a bit of a cold, can't sleep, and rather than toss and turn, down I head to the mancave. <i>nikkigirl</i> needs her rest more than I need my comfort.

    I'll probably catch a few more zzz's before work, but maybe not. Might be a long day today.

    Mail day! Few things exceed the joy of mail day. I used to received dozens of goodies a week and now I give up after less than 10 trades because I'm overwhelmed. lol

    Let's take a look at the packaging and <i>marvel</i> cards in this deal:

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="3am/964402" />

    That <i>dr. strange</i> low-key slaps.

    When <i>mcjesus</i> makes an appearance we always have fun:

    While I'm a super duper casual when it comes to Hockey, I've started to do more than just follow the highlights again and I'm getting excited for the playoffs. Playoff Hockey + <i>mcjesus</i> = oh boy.

    I ❤️ <i>mcjesus</i>.
