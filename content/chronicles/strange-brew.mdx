    <i>nikkigirl</i> and I watched <i>strange brew</i> last night and it might have been peak 2025 sneaking in under the gun:

    <YouTubeVideo id="2pacru8ve9k" orientation="landscape" />

    What can you really say about this movie? I think you just need to watch it, hoser. It's on Amazon Prime Video. Take off, eh.

    PS......shout out to <i>derek</i>. He's almost certainly the first person I ever saw this movie with and it probably was a "dangerous" movie when we did. Couple of 10 year olds, watching some beer chasing hosers, eh?

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" releaseId="88">
    For a good chunk of today, I got back to working on my next <i>giannis</i> box and continuing to work through 2019-20 basketball cards. I'd guess I'm about 50% of my way through 2019-20 and that is the last year left to complete this box. Hopefully, we'll close 'er out this weekend with a bit of luck.

    Anywho, while I am not actively trading (too busy with being a blog boi + work), I have not completely processed all of my trades. Because of that, when I get around to working my way through 2019-20 as an example, I might not have all of the needed cards in one spot, and I need to go pull some non-sorted trades to sort them. What follows are a few highlights from those already completed deals.

    ---

    First up, we have trade 905268 with [Tyrese-haliburton0](https://www.tcdb.com/Profile.cfm/Tyrese-haliburton0). This was our 4th completed deal, and I owe him a 5th because he sent an offer right before I turned off trading, declining his last offer.

    He's also from France, and the international deals always end up being a bit more memorable. France is a hot bed for NBA cards so I probably have half a dozen regulars coming out of France.

    My only beef? He stole the top [tyrese](/cardattack/tcdb-rankings/100) spot from me on <i>tcdb</i>:

    I used to be the top collector by a good margin until he came along. Now, I just can't keep up.

    Here's a couple of fun cards from the deal:

    ![reggie, antwan, & gilbert](/images/optimized/strange-brew/inserts.webp)

    I love me some good 90s and 00s inserts. The top one here is [1994-95 SkyBox Premium - Slammin' Universe SU15 Reggie Miller](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/2273/cid/2998844/1994-95-SkyBox-Premium---Slammin'-Universe-SU15-Reggie-Miller), with the bottom being [2009-10 Donruss Elite - Teamwork Combos 30 Antawn Jamison / Gilbert Arenas](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/32317/cid/3348325/2009-10-Donruss-Elite---Teamwork-Combos-30-Antawn-Jamison-/-Gilbert-Arenas). <i>reggie miller</i> in the Slammin' Universe? lol

    France is good peoples.

    Next item up for bid? Deal 898135 with [griffey423](https://www.tcdb.com/Profile.cfm/griffey423):

    ![griffey423 trade](/images/optimized/strange-brew/griffey423.webp)

    Nothing too exciting about this deal, but when you land any of <i>lulu</i>'s favorite, <i>king james</i>, it's not nothing:

    ![king james](/images/optimized/strange-brew/lebron.webp)

    How handsome.
