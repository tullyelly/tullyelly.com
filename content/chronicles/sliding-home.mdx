Hey there, look at that, a new [homepage](/)! That makes at least 3 versions of the homepage and if you miss the OGs, hit up the [ruins](/tullyelly/ruins) to reminisce. I'm gonna add [T.R.O.Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6mdRv0ZdR8&list=RDk6mdRv0ZdR8&start_radio=1) to the ruins page now that I think about it.

And that my friends, is minor release [shaolin 2.6.0 – 2025-12 minor: homepage refractor](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls).

In between coding sessions, it was <i>jeff meff</i>'s first [crosscourt](https://www.crosscourtvbc.com/) tournament this weekend. Overall, they started off slowly, losing every set in their first four matches. Despite the losses, most were close and they slowing began building steam until they broke through and won the last match 2-0 over [mamba](https://www.mambavolleyball.org/). We see them a lot so that's a good win.

<i>jeff meff</i> played a bit in the first match, and a bunch in the last match
they won. Besides the win, it was fun to see because all of the boys got in on
the last match and contributed to a win. It's a newer team, a deeper team, and
coach is looking to find the right rotations early in the season.

You like to see them all keep battling, and in the last match, their first win, they all get a chance to succeed. They cheer well for each other, and I'm excited to see what's between now and the nationals in Orlando.

Anywho, let's check out how ya boi did:

<div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
  <iframe
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/89WAN0WyRFo"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

If you couldn't quite make that out from the bleachers, how about we watch that again from jesus' perspective:

<div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
  <iframe
    className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
    src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QRiJHPd0o4U"
    title="YouTube video player"
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowFullScreen
  />
</div>

He scored/saved 4 or 5 points in the last match and got to leave with his head held high. There was a particularly nasty spike mixed in there and his bois let him know about it.

Oh, and he got left in to serve to close out the first set (not the usual rotation) and he got all geeked out, over excited, rushed the serve, and hit it too hard.....out. All with a smile on his face.

Here's a bonus shot of our boi <i>prez</i>:

He gets a special shout out because he's been helping to provide mr. <i> meff</i> rides when we've needed an assist. I've started to funnel doordash gift cards to him as part of the money laundering operation we run. Good dude.
