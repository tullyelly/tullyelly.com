    We're back to trading and the first deal of the day has a fun batch of cards on the return side, but that's for the fun mailday post to follow! This deal has 15 cards going both ways and let's take a look:

    Because this one's a bit bigger, I added a few extra pictures to show how it's packed up and sent along its way. It mostly follows the same process as [this](/shaolin/npm-run-james), except where it doesn't. A few notes:

    - The carousel is in alphabetical order, so it's funny to me that the most boring picture is first
    - Please and thank you is for the our favorite <i>usps</i> workers
    - 3 sleeves, 5 cards each
    - The Murray and Garuba cards are generally pretty hard to come by, plus Joker
    - Da Bears still suck

    Overall, quite the fun deal and we'll see why on the return trip.

    Next trade up for review is a 11 card bonanza; 6 going out the door, and 5 heading their way on over. A few pictures to review:

    First off, I love me some Metal cards from the 90's. They immediately stand out in a sea of vintage, junk wax, or modern cards. I love the distinct look and feel of them, and they hold a bit more value than most of the other cards from the mid-nineties.

    Also included, two NBA legends with fantastic NBA stories. First up, <i>linsanity</i>:

    Even better? Let's let other legends fill us in on Yao:

    Smaller deal, maybe not quite as fun of a return, and we'll still get excited with it shows up at the post!

  That Reddit embed above? New feature just added to the blog. I've used it
  [elsewhere](/unclejimmy/squad/bonnibel) on the site, and now it's seamlessly
  integrated into our chronicles here as well. I was never a big Reddit guy, and
  then the rest of the internet fell apart and I've been using it more than ever
  over the past year or three.

In other news, because <i>bonnibel</i>'s car is in the shop, my car is with her, and I was <i>nikkigirl</i>'s chauffeur today (in her car). On my way to pick her up, I somehow woke up in the card shop just a block down the road from her work. Whoopsies:

That's a future HOFer, a HOFer, some rando vets, and some wasted youth added in for good measure. It gets spicier:

Nice batch of our favorite freaky championship teammates. What a handsome batch of cards. There can only be one winner though:

We scored one <i>freak</i> and added an auto to boot.

Shout out to [Fox Cities Cards](https://www.instagram.com/foxcitiescards/?hl=en). I'm known as the "<i>giannis</i> guy" there (because of <i>nikkigirl</i>), and since it's been awhile, they had a nice batch of cheap <i>bucks</i> cards just waiting for me to show up and grab 'em.
