    We're back to trading and the first deal of the day has a fun batch of cards on the return side, but that's for the fun mailday post to follow! This deal has 15 cards going both ways and let's take a look:

    Because this one's a bit bigger, I added a few extra pictures to show how it's packed up and sent along its way. It mostly follows the same process as [this](/shaolin/npm-run-james), except where it doesn't. A few notes:

    - The carousel is in alphabetical order, so it's funny to me that the most boring picture is first
    - Please and thank you is for the our favorite <i>usps</i> workers
    - 3 sleeves, 5 cards each
    - The Murray and Garuba cards are generally pretty hard to come by, plus Joker
    - Da Bears still suck

    Overall, quite the fun deal and we'll see why on the return trip.

    Next trade up for review is a 11 card bonanza; 6 going out the door, and 5 heading their way on over. A few pictures to review:

    First off, I love me some Metal cards from the 90's. They immediately stand out in a sea of vintage, junk wax, or modern cards. I love the distinct look and feel of them, and they hold a bit more value than most of the other cards from the mid-nineties.

    Also included, two NBA legends with fantastic origin stories. First up, <i>linsanity</i>:
