Let's get this out right away; I wanted to call this post lego penis.

I've had a minecraft creeper t-shirt since I first started playing the game....I'll guess 15 years ago.

Anywho, nikkigirl has hated this shirt since day one and always chirps about how ugly it is, but most importantly, how much it just looks like a penis. That's all I needed to place this as the GOAT of t-shirts.

It's barely a t-shirt anymore.

But you know, sharing a URL that included \lego-penis just didn't feel right. So instead, I'll just say penis here instead. Penis, penis, penis, and penis. Love 'em or hate 'em. Penis.

Besides poking momma bear - I'm actually here to share a fun gift lulu got me for my birthday. She got me a lego penis, aka the creeper, and to give myself a break from the "requirements" of mailing cards, or building a website, or the other things that I'd consider work during unemployment, I've started to play with legos again.

In the past few years I avoided legos since I built the '89 batmobile because that's nikkigirl's thing and my card collecting really took off. Well no more! Enter minecraft.

Let's start with a lush cave fight:

How about we check up on steve and baby panda?

Be careful because you might fall into the nether and stumble upon this vicious lava battle:

The real start of the show though? lego penis and his little pig friend:

After all of that building, I went around the house to find all his best buddies and made myself a minecraft sanctuary:

All that to say, I'm back in on minecraft and the last big mission I'm giving myself before returning to work is to figure out how to hack minecraft onto my steam deck so I can start playing the actual game again. I bet I've got another 3000 hours of it in me still.

What a classic.

If you aren't too bored yet, here's some additional <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/J6Ss29iKCoqr2Lc87" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">behind the scenes</a> photos.

Thanks lulu!

I wandered west today and when I head west I like to stop at Seth's coffee. They have my favorite breakfast sandwich in town. If you don't know all of the best breakfast stops in town, I don't think I want to be your friend.

I was heading west to hit up the fox river mall for some work clothes. It was a bust. The search for the perfect lee pant continues.

Hug ball.
