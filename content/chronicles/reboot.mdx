    I've been gone because somehow I bricked my development environment. I got it into my head to attempt a few bug fixes, and in typical if it ain't (really) broke, don't fix it fashion, I bricked myself on Saturday.

    Since then I've been half heartedly chipping away at it before having a breakthrough yesterday. I could have pushed, but didn't. So here we sit.

    My goal of blogging for 365 straight days died at 91. Technically, I made it to 92 days, but that chronicle will forever be lost to history. Shout out to Sergei Federov (91), and Reggie White (92).

    Long story short; as part of the this fix package, my dev server was separated from the content layer, allowing for more flexibility and even more importantly, it helps to highlight/find any issues like the one that took me down this week. It also forced me to upgrade to [Next.js 16.1](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-16-1), which has a variety of performance improvements that I'm already seeing. Ok, "forced" is maybe too strong. It "helped" me decide to bite the bullet.

    Something like 30 files were impacted by this change, and quite a bit had to be re-arranged. Surprisingly, things look pretty good as I click around the site.

    Back to more/other bug fixes tomorrow. Maybe you see me, maybe you don't. lol
