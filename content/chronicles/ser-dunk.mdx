    At the [last card show](derek) I went to with my bestie <i>derek</i>, I met with with one of my best sources for NBA cards, <i>wiscopullz</i>. He and I usually meet up at [Cardboard Legacy](https://cardboardlegacy.com/), but this time I noticed the card show and called an audible because he typically has a table there.

    Anywho, I started to sort his cards today.

    He's a good dude.
