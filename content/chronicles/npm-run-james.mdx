<ReleaseSection alterEgo="mark2" releaseId="105">
    In preparation for the next section, I added a new <i>tcdb</i> mode to the ReleaseSection component. When I pass a <i>tcdb</i> trade ID and trade partner, it will do some automagics, and well, you'll see it shortly.

    This is also an example of how I can create opportunities to integrate <i>tcdb</i> into the site in ways that leave me room to grow into. Plus, I got trades to blog about.

    Iterate.

    Oh, and I also converted these 3 chained testing scripts:

    <CodePanel
        label="Terminal"
        language="bash"
        code={`npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run test`}
    />

    Into an easier to remember script:

    <CodePanel
        label="Terminal"
        language="bash"
        code={`npm run james`}
    />

    Basically, this is what I run to double check the code my robot pal, <i>cipher</i>, has generated. There's a lot of long-term possibility here, so this minor change could blossom into who knows what.

    Iterate.

  Welcome to the newest version of a ReleaseSection. <i>tcdb</i> trades.

Let's step through the process of getting a trade packed up and out the
door. In this first example, while there's only one card, this packing method
would be consistent for any card from 1-5 cards. Thickness, and weight, are
the main two factors that dictate how many cards will fit into this method.

Let's start with one of the GOATs:

Walter might be the only Chicago Bear in history that I won't just straight up trash. Still won't save him from being shipped out the door. Protection level 1, find a junk penny sleeve to replace the sleeve I pulled it in:

![junk sleeve](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/junk-sleeve.webp)

Sleeves with stickers, writing, or significant dirtiness get set aside for <i>tcdb</i> trades. Protection level 2, tape penny sleeve closed:

![taped sleeve](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/tape-sleeve.webp)

This little bit of taped pressure prevents the cards from moving, every so slightly. Protection level 3, semi-rigid top loader:

![semi-rigid top loader](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/semi-rigid.webp)

Another crappy, dirty supply, set aside to temporarily protect the cards while they are in transit with the <i>usps</i>. Protection level 4, tape the semi-rigid closed:

![taped semi-rigid](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/tape-semi-rigid.webp)

Every bit helps. Protection level 5, tape to first piece of cardboard:

![taped to cardboard](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/tape-to-cardboard.webp)

The cardboard's primary purpose is to fill as much of the envelope as possible, providing a buffer on all four sides of the cards. Ideally, the cardboard used in this process is as thin and strong as possible. Protection level 6, second piece of cardboard:

At this stage, I also make sure to add the trade ID somewhere on the packaging. Protection level 7, envelope time:

![envelope](/images/optimized/npm-run-james/envelope.webp)

Both edges of the envelope are enhanced with packing tape. Theoretically, my multi-layer protection has its rigity so evenly spread, and so thinly, that it will just slice right through the other envelopes and machines it will encounter between me and my trading pal.

Shout out to the tooling that helps along the way:

Some don't think one card is enough to justify the cost of the postage. I will help the tading community with trades ranging from one into infinity.

The card I'm getting back is quite dorky, and I'm excited for it.
