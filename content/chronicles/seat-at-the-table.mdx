<ReleaseSection alterEgo="george">
    I was in the most impactful meeting of my life this morning. Life altering impactful. It was so impactful that I spent a good two hours explaining to <i>nikkigirl</i> how proud I was of myself. A deeply personal and emotional moment shared between lifelong partners. I've never done that before. Ever.

    I realized just how much every moment in my life prepared me for today's meeting. I was ready. I was confident. I was funny. I deserved to be where I was.

    I earned a seat at the table.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="theabbott">
    After the first section written today, I spent some time with program design for a bit, did a bit of housework (I needed me time), and had my favorite music on shuffle. Typically, I am a full album, front to back kind of guy. After a while though? I need the choas of random ideas to flood my brain and snap me out of the monotony of it all. Well this random moment aligned with today's theme and here we go......

    First song? [Live and Let Live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72-J-kRR1v4&list=RD72-J-kRR1v4&start_radio=1) by Souls of Mischief. The chorus:

    <i>
        I give it all I got, that's all I got to give <br />
        Yo, you got to live and let live <br />
        I give it all I got, that's all I got to give <br />
        Yo, you gotta live and let live
    </i>

    Next item up for bid - [The Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6qCHkJVq2w&list=RDP6qCHkJVq2w&start_radio=1) (feat Common & Talib Kweli) by Pharoahe Monch. I absolutely ❤️ this song. First released in 1999, this is a direct hit for me. Full bulls-eye. This song speaks to my soul. A few key lines from each player:

    <b>Pharoahe Monch:</b>
    <i>
        Yo, truth had me up against the ropes<br />
        Semi-conscious without no boxing skills<br />
        Fear of it makes hair on my neck grow like minoxidil<br />
    </i>

    <b>Common:</b>
    <i>
        Let the truth be told from young souls that become old<br />
        From days spent in the jungle, where must one go to find it?<br />
        Time is real, we can't rewind it<br />
        Out of everybody I met, who told the truth? Time did
    </i>

    <b>Talib Kweli:</b>
    <i>
        Heavenly, what will set you free and kill you in the same breath (What?)<br />
        That shit you gotta get off your chest before your death<br />
        Unless the way you speak is lighter than a pamphlet<br />
        'Cause the truth give the words the weight of a planet, goddamnit<br />
    </i>

    Third is the turd. Ever heard that terrible 2nd grade joke? First is the worst.......second is the best......third is the turd. We will also accept.......third is the nerd. I love terrible 2nd grade jokes.

    Anywho, third song on the list is [Cecilia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5uei2AFEaQ&list=RDe5uei2AFEaQ&start_radio=1) by Simon and Garfunkel. Okay, so this one won't really fit the theme here so we are going to skip over this one because I couldn't find a good idea here. Or did I?

    As "The Truth" was 4told - get it 4, uh, told, fourth song. Eek, moving along.

    Point being, the next song is [American Terrorist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0RMLbvioXs&list=RDp0RMLbvioXs&start_radio=1) by Lupe Fiasco. Now, here we pause to make note of the absolute disaster that this country is. Think about the words American Terrorist for a moment. How relevant is that today? How long has it been before you realize that every day feels like today? America was born on terrorism.

    Within the sadness that is the last paragraph, Lupe starts the song with this simple ideal:

    <i>
        Close your mind<br />
        Close your eyes, see with your heart
    </i>

    How about a play on the number 5 for our fifth song?

    <YouTubeVideo
        id="jU6k-nLEkPY"
        playlist="jU6k-nLEkPY"
        loop
        orientation="landscape"
        />

    What a great movie. As somebody who talks to computers for a living, I can assure you: Johnny 5 Is Alive.

    We jump back into the music with [Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTtyxBd18yQ&list=RDzTtyxBd18yQ&start_radio=1) by The Roots. After a detour into Cecilia, who's breaking my heart, we jumped into American Terrorist and the shit show that is today. With [Game Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_theory) we get back on message. Hit that last link if you are unfamiliar with the concept in this context.

    If I was to simplify how I ended up with a <i>seat at the table</i> into one idea, it would be Game Theory. While I'm not perfect, I've also played my cards right.

    Quick batch of lyrics from Black Thought:

    <i>
        Night ridin' on 'em like my last name Hasselhoff<br />
        Voted unlikely to succeed cause my class was full<br />
        Of naysayers, cheaters and thieves<br />
        All it gave me was a good enough reason to leave
    </i>

    I love Knight Rider. Full stop.

    I'm bored with the number games so we jump right into [Starin' Through My Rear View](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JzDCFfbenA&list=RD9JzDCFfbenA&start_radio=1) by 2Pac. This song aligns with what my day has been like. In my most vulnerable moments today, I mapped the where I am today all the way back to my earliest memories. Everything has mattered. I'm where I should be.

    2pac can take it away from here:

    <i>
        I'm seein nothing but my dreams coming true<br />
        While I'm staring at the world through my rearview<br />
        See I'm seeing nothing but my dreams coming true<br />
        While I'm staring at the world through my rearview see<br />
        They got me staring at the world through my rearview
    </i>

    Last, but certainly not least, we close with the feminine voice found within [Every Single Night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bIlLq4BqGdg&list=RDbIlLq4BqGdg&start_radio=1) by Fiona Apple. Take it away m'lady:

    <i>
        Every single night<br />
        I endure the flight<br />
        Of little wings of white-flamed<br />
        Butterflies in my brain<br />
        These ideas of mine<br />
        Percolate the mind<br />
        Trickle down the spine<br />
        Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze<br />
        That's where the pain comes in<br />
        Like a second skeleton<br />
        Trying to fit beneath the skin<br />
        I can't fit the feelings in<br />
        Every single night's alight with my brain<br />
    </i>

    ---

    I know it's taken us awhile to get here so let's summarize. TL;DR (Too Long; Didn't Read):

    <i>
        I give it all I've got<br />
        that's all I've got to give<br />
        accompanied by the search for truth<br />
        even the ugly truth<br />
        lead with your heart<br />
        if I start starin' through the world in my rearview<br />
        I've come to realize that every single night with my brain<br />
        has landed me this seat at the table
    </i>

    That TL;DR was originally written as a summary paragraph and then I decided to chop it up into pieces to fit the previous formatting and lyrics from my favorite song writers. It wasn't written to rhyme, but as Nas would tell you: [It Was Written](https://www.google.com/search?q=nas+it+was+written&rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1133US1133&oq=nas+it+was+&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyDAgCEAAYFBiHAhiABDIGCAMQRRg5Mg0IBBAAGJECGIAEGIoFMg0IBRAAGJECGIAEGIoFMgcIBhAAGIAEMg0IBxAAGJECGIAEGIoFMgcICBAAGIAEMgcICRAAGIAE0gEIMzY1OWowajmoAgawAgHxBTgSnsAof3o8&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
