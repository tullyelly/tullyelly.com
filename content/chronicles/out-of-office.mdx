I actually played with some cards today. It's been one thing after another around here lately, and having a job just ruins the fun by leaving little room for play. Well not today! Today I got back to <i>tcdb</i>, dispositioned a few things I have left hanging, and started on 2019-20 basketball.

Because I get so many trade offers and can't find the time to pick up a card, let alone ship it to someone, I have turned off trades and added an out of office message to the site:

Well, that, plus an old pal stopping by led to fun message showing up in my inbox:

AAARRT! As previously noted in the [vault](/cardattack), nikkigirl and I love when AAARRT shows up; so of course she's smitten:

AAARRT is a class act that typically shows up around this time of the year to spread some holiday cheer and few things bring a smile to our face quicker than when AAARRT stops by.

Merry Christmas Art.

Before we close out let's check in on some content I found laying around on the chopping floor.

This is what I wore to my work party:

Here's a google remix of a photo nikkigirl took of me while I was working:

Last one.....lotta memories tucked into this photo of my view from the 8th floor at work:
