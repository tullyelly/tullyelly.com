<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack">
  While I waited for <i>new emma</i> to wake up, I finished working my way through a box from [zebra breaks](https://district.net/u/zebrabreaks) holding a bunch of 2025-26 Topps Flagship basketball along with some other flotsam & jetsam from 2024-25. <i>zebra</i> is part of the broader <i>mbb</i> universe and is one of the few [breakers](https://www.prospectslive.com/these-are-the-breaks-an-introduction-to-card-breaking/) that I still engage with a few times a year.

Did you see the first image from that last link? Uncle Jimmy's Breaks? Not me, promise. What are the odds that the first link I pulled to explain what a breaker is has Uncle Jimmy's Breaks in it? Must be a [simulation](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/14bmllo/are_we_in_a_simulation_would_love_to_hear_your/).

While the batch of cards was pretty meh, there's always a banger or two. Here's the funnest <i>giannis</i> (sandglitter) :

And a funner kareem (pink holo foil):

  Next, we made a pit stop to see some familiar faces at my dad's xmas part. The bestie circle has grown +1:

  After dropping off the little princess with mom and dad, I got back to some work I left hanging this morning. Basically, I can now tag any section of the daily chronicles blog with the alter ego the content attaches too. In this section's example, we are <i>mark2</i>......for reasons that are only important to me for now.

See the lower right of each section to find the latest trick. Tomorrow, hopefully another trick.

Oh, and I almost forgot a trick. I can now link directly to a release, like the the [one I'm working in right now](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls/86) to deliver my next set of features. Almost done with that one [86]; there's just one more batch of coding to finish the thought.

Iterate.
