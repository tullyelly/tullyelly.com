A few minor cleanup items today.

The last time I was in a [hug ball](/unclejimmy/hug-ball), bonnie told me that I smelled bad. I did smell bad.

It took me a few different attempts, and a few different versions, but I did finally get minecraft running on my steam deck earlier week to keep a [promise with myself](/shaolin/the-creeper). I'm running an instance of android and running the bedrock edition of minecraft there. That gives me access to my previous realm, and allows for others to join and play from just about any device.

I promptly got lost and I spent most of this week's playtime trying to find my compound again. Still haven't found it.

For my most production portion of the day, I finished loading the rest of the 2005 football cards in derek's boxes. That leaves me another 4,000 or so of the original 15,000 still to be loaded.

It'll be interesting to see how much time I'll be dedicating to cards to close the year with a new job.

Speaking of the new gig - tomorrow's the first day. Today, I booted up the laptop they mailed to me and got it ready for tomorrow's orientation. Tomorrow is remote, Tuesday is on-site.

I'm going to miss doing whatever the hell I want.
