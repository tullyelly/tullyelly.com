eeeeeeeemma got herself a new job today and will join nikkigirl, lulu, and p-funk in the rental car world. She'll be up in GB so she gets to be closer to her boo when she's working.

Speaking of corbin, he was added to eeeeeeeemma's support group chat with her "grown-ups" and we were joking that we'd also be his parental support unit as well and he said......you already are. Melts your heart just a bit.

Good lad.

Speaking of jobs, the political plot just keeps getting thicker at [redacted]. It's a never ending pit that I've almost fallen into multiple times. For some reason, it's still fun as fuck tho and I'm building a solid network along the way.

Ya boi is putting on his best Switzerland zoot suit to avoid getting sucked into WWIII. How do I plan to stay neutral, while maintaining maximum readiness for future opportunities?
