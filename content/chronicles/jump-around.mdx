    Let's start off with the one, and the only, <i>jeff meff</i>. Day 2 of the tournament picked up where we left off and he got a bunch more playing time today.

    <FolderImageCarousel folder="jump-around/jeff-meff" />

    They landed in a tough bracket for this tournament - first 3 matches against top 30(ish) programs nationally - and they hung tight day one, keeping it close all three matches. Day two loosened up a bit and we manage to sneak out a 3 set tiebreaker win. Thrilla in the Millawaukee.

    Best play of the day:

    I completed what I [made note of yesterday](/shaolin/pac-man), and ensured the links found in a completed <i>tcdb</i> trade point to the right page, regardless of what side you are clicking from.

    Go to [pac-man](/shaolin/pac-man) and try it out:

    ![example](/images/optimized/jump-around/example.webp)

    Next vague idea: Create some sort of anchor function that takes you directly to the right section on a page so in this case you would go right to the trade, rather than having to scroll to find it.

    Iterate.

    I decided to turn trading off again for the time being because 9 active trades was just too much extra stress. Work, family, blog boi, vibe coding, and trades is a lot of to do lists to keep in order.

    It's also fun, so we won't be gone long. Hopefully.

    PS......the swing through trades gave me the opportunity to add some cool (4 me) functionality to the site, and there's much more to come there. My audience might take a nice little jump along the way if I play my cards right.

    Pun intended.

    Small, but fun deal starts out with some shiny <i>marvel</i>:

    ![marvel](/images/optimized/jump-around/marvel.webp)

    Quick pitstop with the Lions for a Detroit fan:

    ![lions](/images/optimized/jump-around/lions.webp)

    And now the prize of the (small) pack:

    ![pistons](/images/optimized/jump-around/pistons.webp)

    This Pistons card is a SP (Short Print) and it came from the <i>card & coin</i> buy one, get one envelopes. The 50 cents I paid for the envelope will pay out 4X on the card I'm getting back for it.

    I'm obviously rich.

        In the next deal, I think I might have found an Andretti fan:

    ![andretti](/images/optimized/jump-around/andretti.webp)

    Shouts to Michael Andretti tho. He's probably the first driver who ever registered in this young sports fan's head.

    I love me a good trade that's all the same set (or mostly). Find the box, find the section, pull, pack and done. Another example:

    ![kraken](/images/optimized/jump-around/kraken.webp)

    Andrew is my best, okay probably only, Kraken customer. I used to join breaks if the Kraken were cheap enough because I know that he'll scoop them right up. Great fella.

    More to come with Andrew.

    And with these three small deals, my trade window as closed. This week send trades, next week log trades.

    I just learned how to invent two weeks of repeatable content any time I want.
