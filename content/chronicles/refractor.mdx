I continued to take a step back from finishing v2.5.0 again today and instead focused on some bugs and chores that have been sitting out there for awhile. It kept me productive while keeping me away from the burnout of the bigger picture. When I find myself frustrated, especially with something on my own timeline, I don't mind stepping away to give myself some clarity for when I return.

As part of these bug fixes, I also worked on automating SEO (Search Engine Optimization) functionality as well as building tests to ensure all of the stuff I deploy is ready for the Google machines. I then plugged shaolin-scrolls & tcdb-rankings into this new structure, which is kind of a backdoor way back into the bigger v2.5.0 picture. Coding, but with low stakes.

The worst part of even smallish changes like this? Getting the damn tests to work. If only I hadn't decided to do it the "right" way. Everything might be 2x faster. :)

I also went for my typical 2-3 mile walk to and from a mailbox today to send a couple of packages to our friendly Canadian neighbors to the north. One envelope was a return to sender because I didn't have the proper postage (fixed) and the other will get me back the last card from 2023-24 Hoops in return. Set collectors unite!

Tomorrow is interview number three with a company that shall not be named lest the aggregators get a hold of it. I'm less nervous than the second interview, but it's today and not tomorrow so there will definitely be more nerves and pacing showing up.

I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I feel good. I might throw up. I feel good. I feel good.

Let's close with a summary of what the bot and I worked on together today. lol, oh yeah, visiting a shaolin temple was added to the bucket list. Which means I have to build a bucket list, which means.......take it away robot pal.

## mr. robot says......

- **CI Tests:** Ran `npm run test:seo`, contentlayer built successfully, Playwright passed.
- **Git Error:** Accidentally committed to `refractor-blog` instead of `shaolin-scrolls-fixes`; need to move commit and clean history.
- **Cipher Prompt:** Requested a safe, reversible Git fix prompt for branch correction.
- **UI Dialogs:** Fixed bleed-through of headers and breadcrumbs; backdrop readability restored.
- **UI Polish:** Dialog width still slightly wide;needs a gentle reduction to match production feel.
