lulu called me today to see if we are going to my xmas work party tomorrow night, and spoiler alert, we aren't. nikkigirl is down in Madison getting awards for being the best employee ever, and if she's not available to carry the conversation I'm gonna have to pass. Plus, there's a more exclusive work party next week that I'm definitely gonna hit up.

Only so much party in ya boi.

lulu also asked if I blogged yet today and when I asked if she had read yesterday's, she noted that I spelled her name wrong ([IYKYK](/shaolin/mamas-big-ones)). I've got a growing number of loyal readers and a shrinking number of overall clicks - along with some plans to run some tests on ya'll to see how I can gin up some engagment to reduce the bounce rate.

The real story is she found my missing idea when she asked me if my #1 listened to artist this year was <i>post malone</i>. Another spoiler alert, he wasn't......though I did give him some run because I love my little girl. I doubt I've had a year that was more country than this one, as little as it actually was. Still, banger alert:

Anywho, that conversation reminded me that I was one of the top listeners of <i>gza</i> last month and I was gonna post(malone?) about that before it flittered away. I guess I already did [post](/shaolin/4th-chamber)(malone?) about it kinda sorta. Speaking of which, I made it onto the rave's facebook page:

Focus sir. Here's all of the badges I've gotten on youtube over the past year+, including our friend mr. <i>genius</i>:

Remember when I mentioned my one and only series of paintings [yesterday](/shaolin/mamas-big-ones)? Well, if you rewind a year and look at how much I listened to <i>bjork</i>, you'll see just how in my feelings I was while I painted.

When I finished the first of my paintings it was so bad that I had full-on breakdown. Long story short (short story will arrive longer eventually); her album <i>homogenic</i> snapped me out of it and I only painted listening to that album from that point forward to finish the series.

I've already pre-written something upstairs about how every song on that album speaks directly to that time in my life. One day I'll pull it out and formalize it here. Perhaps sooner rather than later.

So there you have it. She saved me.

Oh, and number two on her list was mr. <i>bieber</i>. Some things never change. Speaking of <i>bieber</i> and paintings......man, I have to get on that idea already.

P.S. lulu, here's the [hashtag](/shaolin/tags/lulu) we talked about. I bet you'll think I haven't written about you enough. lol
