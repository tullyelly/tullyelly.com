Closed a sprint from last week that was lighter than usual for a few reasons.

- More bug fixes (not wrapped in a sprint) than planned work
- More card work recently; acquiring and loading 20,000 cards is a lot of time
  <br />
  Good news though, the touch interface testing is finally resolved and in
  production. Or.......it got past local tests and then to end to end testing
  before barfing on me. Guess we'll keep fighting into tomorrow.

The real mission today was to get some shoes for the big in-person interview tomorrow. Mission accomplished. Plus, some more new work pants too!

Just about wrapped up my GIANNIS-TWO-TIME-MVP box as well. Just a bit of paint and color to add tomorrow and we'll move on to box three. I like the way this new universal sorting system is working out so far.

Can't wait to hate it later.
