If you are curious about how I am handling a tough time, check out <a href="/shaolin/this-feeling">this feeling</a> from yesterday. It's a lovely song by a lovely singer.

While no one can walk in another's shoes, I have a very good idea what eeeeeeeemma is going through right now, and I can all but assure you that she is handling it better than I ever did. Beyond that, and what I will share with her and her alone, the plan is to keep walking my path expecting that she'll be joining me again very soon.

As for what's next, lol. Might as well make an ass of myself to pass the time. I had planned on doing this yesterday, then yesterday I realized I couldn't so I made another plan for a post, and then eeeeeeeemma took precedence over everything. In the end, this landed right where it should have, as will the other idea I plan to visit with tomorrow.

This idea popped into my head 3 or 4 weeks ago, and as I've encountered things on my journey, I've been pulling them in and incorporating them here. Rather than let the idea dictate the action, I like to let the action dictate the idea - it's amazing how things work out if you let them simmer for just a touch longer than you originally anticipated.

Anywho, I am contractually required to perform like this for nikkigirl any time this song comes on. When he hits both woos......it's on like Donkey Kong.

Without further ado:

nikkigirl was around today unexpectedly, so all of these were recorded within an
hour window while she stepped out. It is both exacty how it should be, and not
quite what I would ideally have wanted. In the rush I spaced one particular idea
and am REALLY upset about forgetting to include it, but much like my approach to
eeeeeeeemma's journey, I believe that things worked out as they should have.

As an aside, I had to piss in a cup this week, and I can assure you that I did not have red eyes while the war on drugs was being fought. I almost got to release this on the same day as the test, but alas, jesus had other ideas.

TL;DR: I had fun today.
