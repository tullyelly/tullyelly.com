    Oh, so when I said I was done with trading because I turned it off - well there's actually one proprosal I sent out right before turning new offers off. Luke originally sent me an offer that included 350+ cards across both sides and while it was close, it didn't hit the mark for me. Instead, I sent him a new offer with 166 cards on each side, and it looks like he'll accept it, pending the pulling and confirmation he has all of the cards.

    I'm very pleased with the deal. Larger deals are a blessing and a curse though. Lots of work around the bend.

    <i>nikkigirl</i> has been struggling some terrible pain in her
    hands, and first of all - she's stronger than me. Always has been. The #1
    reason I know this? Because she's had to deal with me all of these years.
    Anytime I share my victories, it's only because of her. NOBODY has been as
    ride or die for me. Ever. <i>unclejimmy</i> in particular, is just
    as much me, as it is her. None of it is without her.

    All of that to say, she's exhausted, went to bed early, and I was thrilled to have some alone time. lol

    As I head to my backpack to grab my earbuds, I think to myself, self, let's go random again tonight, wait for a song to speak to me, and we'll use that to drive the evenings chronicle. Well, I didn't have to wait long because the first song was an absolute banger:

    Iconic. Absolutely legendary. The amount of pure hours I have dedicated to the <i>wu-tang clan</i> over the years feels incalculable. Actually studied. Murals. Playlists. Mixtapes. Somebody once asked me if I was Muslim based on how much 5 percenter I can parrot. I was there on the ground floor of a collective that changed the world.

    Before we get to the point, it should be pointed out that while <i>inpsectah dek's</i> verse on Triumph is widely considered the greatest verse in hip-hop history, I think it might be my 3rd or 4th favorite <i>dek</i> verse. My favorite?

    What a hopeful, peaceful, and glorious song. Infinite skills create miracles.

    Ok, so the point is, I was in a meeting today with 15 of my peers. All of which have been at [redacted] longer than I. Anywho, I was one of 3 in the meeting who had the opportunity to have a [seat at the table](/shaolin/seat-at-the-table). In that moment, I felt the Triumph that was the entirety of my life, and frankly was......Above The Clouds.

    <i>
    It has come to our attention that a mysterious force is loose<br/>
    Somewhere in outer space <br />
    The mysteries of creation is there <br />
    Up in the sky, up in the sky <br />
    The moon and the planets are there <br />
    And new hopes for knowledge and peace are there <br />
    And therefore as we set sail; we ask God's blessing <br />
    On the most hazardous, and dangerous, and greatest adventure <br />
    Of which man has ever embarked
    </i>

    Infinite skills create miracles.
