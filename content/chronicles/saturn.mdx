    I listened to <i>songs in the key of life</i> a LOT. August was a rough month for me this year because it's when I hit the one year anniversary of quitting my job and I was going through a bit of imposter syndrom and more.

    Fast forward to today and we are STILL shooting each other in the streets.

    Hey <i>stevie</i>, swing by on your way to Saturn. Fuck this place.
