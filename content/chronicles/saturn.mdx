    Let's rewind a little bit and revist a brief obsession of mine:

    ![stevie saturn](/images/optimized/saturn/stevie.webp)

    I listened to <i>songs in the key of life</i> a LOT. August was a rough month for me this year because it's when I hit the one year anniversary of quitting my job and I was going through a bit of imposter syndrom and more.

    Really though, I wasn't feeling attached to the world anymore. An outsider, a bit lost, and kinda wanting to be anywhere, but here. Enter <i>saturn</i>:

    <div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
        <iframe
            className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
            src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z2cJRiLDd2k?si=6yZr6AC7DEjuyYuW"
            title="YouTube video player"
            frameBorder="0"
            allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
            allowFullScreen
        />
    </div>

    Fast forward to today and we are STILL shooting each other in the streets.

    Hey <i>stevie</i>, swing by on your way to Saturn. Fuck this place.
