I didn't sleep well last night - mostly because I had two glasses of wine and when I do, there's a decent chance I'll be awake at 3am with little to do about it. Even if I don't drink there's a 1 in 5 chance that I'm up at 3 and starting my day.

Enough whinging.

nikkigirl and I walked to St. E's today to visit eeeeeeeemma and because of my lack of sleep, I was kind of a dick about it. She also won at scrabble during our hospital visit so it's possible that a divorce may be imminent. There was cheating and terrible strategy by other players so I won't be acknowledging this as a defeat.

All in all we ended up walking just shy of 8 miles here and there. We got some breakfast, visited at the hospital, stopped at a used book store, then a bookbar, and then headed home. It was a productive day.

I just got off the phone with eeeeeeeemma for our evening call and she is doing well. She's reading a book that I gave her and I think she's actually enjoying it. Good job, dad.
