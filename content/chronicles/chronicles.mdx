    Here's me. I created the guts of a blog, along with a full authority system, menus, breadcrumbs, and a bunch of new content. Heck even Google login was integrated if you think you can find it - let me know if you do, it's there. That said, I'm done for this week. No mas.

    Could be bugs. Let me know if something is borked.

    Wanna blog daily, we'll see how well that works.

    One Love.
