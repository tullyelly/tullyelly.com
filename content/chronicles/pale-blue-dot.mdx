    Place for the hotfix itself. My notes said: <i>Why are we here?</i> I think that's a bit above my pay grade older me. lol

    I added a Legend to the [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) app to help me quickly find what I need to generate a new release. I almost did this 2 weeks ago, thought to myself, well self, why don't we just create a better way to generate a new release and skip the legend. That'll be super easy.

    Well, yeah. That never happened. Back to baby steps gentlemen, baby steps.

    Check it out!

    Next on the docket......creating a new chronicle blog post is pretty annoying too. It's not super time consuming, but there was a 10 step process that could easily be trimmed to 2 or 3. Enter:
    <CodePanel
        label="Terminal"
        language="bash"
        code={`npm run new-chronicle "pale blue dot"`}
    />

    Running that inside of my repo will generate the day's skeletal page, and create a folder for any images that are needed. I'm not super thrilled with how images are handled right now, but bigger fish and all.

    In this example, I passed in the name for today's page.

    All that to save 36.2 seconds times infinity.

    Like that dark code panel from above? Well, me too. That component was just created so I can drop commands, scripts, or other code into here, there, or everywhere over the long run.

    Me likey. Let's play with it again.
