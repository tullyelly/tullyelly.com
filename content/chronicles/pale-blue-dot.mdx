    I added a Legend to the [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) app to help me quickly find what I need to generate a new release. I almost did this 2 weeks ago, thought to myself, well self, why don't we just create a better way to generate a new release and skip the legend. That'll be super easy.

    Well, yeah. That never happened. Back to baby steps gentlemen, baby steps.

    Check it out!
