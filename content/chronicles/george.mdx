<ReleaseSection alterEgo="george" releaseId="89">
    I started off today by beginning to work my way back through every chronicle for some refractor and cleanup, including, but not limited to:

    - Add alterEgo (the hashtag included in each section)
    - Attach Releases (the purple box around this section)
    - General tag cleanup

    As part of that adventure, I decided to introduce a new alterEgo to the site. Meet <i>george</i>, he's here to capture any portion of the blog ecosystem that is related to work content. Due to the nature of the company, the customers we service, and the sometimes sensitive nature of what may be written, I will never reference the company directly.

    Enter, <i>george</i>. Here's a hint on why I chose this tag name:

    <div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
    <iframe
        className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
        src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Cs3Pvmmv0E?si=SV4qh3-kbChSc4t9"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameBorder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowFullScreen
    />
    </div>

    Not all of my multiple personalities are sure about <i>george</i> yet, so they are only allowed to show up in the chronicles portion of the site for now. While 🧠 [mark2](/mark2) is tentatively on board, we're going to let the other voices in my head argue about it further before really committing to the new alterEgo.

    Quiet as it's kept, <i>tullyelly</i> is a little jealous because work ideas that used to get logged as <i>tullyelly</i>, will now get logged as <i>george</i>, and the lead they built up on the hashtag leaderboard is going to start to diminish as I work my way through the rest of the site. I'm pretty sure that I will be able to broker some peace between me, myself, and I.

    You never know though......stay tuned.

    Side note: as part of this release, I updated the color of the "chore" release type found in [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) to be purple. 3 good reasons for that:
    - It's <i>jeff meff</i>'s favorite color
    - Milwaukee Bucks classic purple hasn't been used on the site yet
    - "chore" was sharing the same color as "wax" (really annoyed me)

    <ScrollAmendment>
        Summary of what was installed today:
        - Chronicles 1-10 were refractored
        - Chore is now purple
        - Merged ScrollAmendment functionality into chronicles
        - Playing around with ScrollAmendment styling

    Speaking of [redacted], I closed my day today on a call with someone just wrapping up their first week with the organization. They had grand ideas, good ones, and they left the meeting on cloud nine because of how open I was to their ideas. I've had some great conversations this week.

    2026 is gonna be lit, bro.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="cardattack" releaseId="90">
    Before I ask you to indulge today's card journey, quick note on this burnt orange border: this is a newly created release type called <i>tcdb</i>. Now that I look back on 90 releases in [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls), I'm starting to see trends and expanding or contracting my statuses, types, and whatchamacallits as I learn more.

    I'm quite fond of the new <i>tcdb</i> release type. I do a lot of good work in this space.

    Anywho, today I'm back at trying to close out 2019-20 and this next <i>giannis</i> box, starting with [2019-20 Panini Illusions](https://www.tcdb.com/CollectionSummary.cfm/sid/239570).

    I organized, sorted, and moved about 50 cards into a new home today. The most current, final home (lol). I really kind of dig this set, and there ended up being a dozen or so fun <i>giannis</i> cards in the mix. These were two of my favorites:

    ![giannis illusions](/images/optimized/george/giannis-illusions.webp)

    On the left, we have [2019-20 Panini Encased - Purple #94 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/247797/cid/15389649/2019-20-Panini-Encased---Purple-94-Giannis-Antetokounmpo) numbered to /35. Ok, this one isn't Illusions, but trust me, it makes sense why it's here......moving along. Nothing too thrilling about this card other than there's only 35 of them. 😉

    On the right, we have [2019-20 Panini Illusions - Season Highlights Sapphire #20 Giannis Antetokounmpo](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewCard.cfm/sid/242677/cid/15055083/2019-20-Panini-Illusions---Season-Highlights-Sapphire-20-Giannis-Antetokounmpo) numbered to /199. This one presents better in person and has a little sizzle to it. Fun card.

    One of the fun parts of the larger <i>giannis</i> project I'm working on is that it requires I touch every card and that means I get to see them again too. With this many cards, I might not see any given card for years; or ever again in the right circumstances. I've had these two cards for 4 and 5 years, respectively, and I couldn't tell you the last time I looked at either of these cards.

    Adding them here brings me peace.
