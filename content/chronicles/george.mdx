<ReleaseSection alterEgo="george" releaseId="89">
    I started off today by beginning to work my way back through every chronicle for some refractor and cleanup, including, but not limited to:

    - Add alterEgo (the hashtag included in each section)
    - Attach Releases (the purple box around this section)
    - General tag cleanup

    As part of that adventure, I decided to introduce a new alterEgo to the site. Meet <i>george</i>, he's here to capture any portion of the blog ecosystem that is related to work content. Due to the nature of the company, the customers we service, and the sometimes sensitive nature of what may be written, I will never reference the company directly.

    Enter, <i>george</i>. Here's a hint on why I chose this tag name:

    <div className="relative mx-auto w-full aspect-[16/9]">
    <iframe
        className="absolute inset-0 w-full h-full rounded-lg"
        src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Cs3Pvmmv0E?si=SV4qh3-kbChSc4t9"
        title="YouTube video player"
        frameBorder="0"
        allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
        allowFullScreen
    />
    </div>

    Not all of my multiple personalities are sure about <i>george</i> yet, so they are only allowed to show up in the chronicles portion of the site for now. While 🧠 [mark2](/mark2) is tentatively on board, we're going to let the other voices in my head argue about it further before really committing to the new alterEgo.

    Quiet as it's kept, <i>tullyelly</i> is a little jealous because work ideas that used to get logged as <i>tullyelly</i>, will now get logged as <i>george</i>, and the lead they built up on the hashtag leaderboard is going to start to diminish as I work my way through the rest of the site. I'm pretty sure that I will be able to broker some peace between me, myself, and I.

    You never know though......stay tuned.

    Side note: as part of this release, I updated the color of the "chore" release type found in [shaolin scrolls](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) to be purple. 3 good reasons for that:
    - It's <i>jeff meff</i>'s favorite color
    - Milwaukee Bucks classic purple hasn't been used on the site yet
    - "chore" was sharing the same color as "wax" (really annoyed me)

    <ScrollAmendment>
        Summary of what was installed today:
        - Chronicles 1-10 were refractored
        - Chore is now purple
        - Merged ScrollAmendment functionality into chronicles
        - Playing around with ScrollAmendment styling
    </ScrollAmendment>

    Speaking of [redacted], I closed my day today on a call with someone just wrapping up their first week with the organization. They had grand ideas, good ones, and they left the meeting on cloud nine because of how open I was to their ideas. I've had some great conversations this week.

    2026 is gonna be lit, bro.
