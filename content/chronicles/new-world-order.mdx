<ReleaseSection alterEgo="george">
  I verbally accepted the offer today. It's on like Donkey Kong.

<ReleaseSection alterEgo="tullyelly">
    Today's coding adventures included SEO optimization improvements to:

    - ruins (also added a note to the page)
    - 11 others in one batch

    <br />

    Next, I moved shaolin from under the alter egos section in the mobile menu to right underneath the home button.

    Last, I took a snapshot of the brain map so it will be ready for shaolin v.2.5.0's release tomorrow.

Tomorrow, we ride.
