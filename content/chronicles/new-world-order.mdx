I verbally accepted the offer today. It's on like Donkey Kong.

Today's coding adventures included SEO optimization improvements to:

- ruins (also added a note to the page)
- 11 others in one batch

<br />

Next, I moved shaolin from under the alter egos section in the mobile menu to right underneath the home button.

Last, I took a snapshot of the brain map so it will be ready for shaolin v.2.5.0's release tomorrow.

Tomorrow, we ride.

Hug ball.
