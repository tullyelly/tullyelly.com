  I took the afternoon off, walked over to the high school, and surprised <i>eeeeeeeemma</i> by showing up for her last performance in [Avenue Q](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_Q). Well, I wanted to surprise her, but the doors were locked, I texted her to confirm I was even allowed, and the gig was up.

Two years ago, she performed in [Rent](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_(musical)>), and while that was fun, this one was much better - mostly because of the production & sound quality. This was my second time seeing it and the crowd today, 99% fellow students, was much more fun than the stuffy Sunday afternoon crowd I first saw it with.

Great group all around, click play here to see more:

I took a bit of time tonight to create the image carousel component above and below this paragraph. It's using a third-party package, so hopefully there's some more cool stuff to play with under the covers.

Please forgive my semi-terrible stealth photography, phones were supposed to be snugly tucked away and not to be used.

Anywho, check out <i>eeeeeeeemma</i>

  <i>eeeeeeeemma</i> remains our [shining star](/shaolin/shining-star), and it is a pleasure to see the art that she continues to create. 
  
  She inspires me, and this blog is a reflection of that inspiration.
