Minimal coding today. I am currently fighting with the emoji in the header rendering to different variations, one immediately, and one on the final page load. UI changes are easily the hardest thing for me to talk the bot into doing - first, because I'm not fluent enough to speak the language, and second, because CSS is a nightmare, even on its best day. At least the way I've always experienced it.

The menu also shows up intermittently on the desktop and I'll need to address this sooner or later. Might pivot to that if the emojis keep giving me the sad face.

I started the day by packing up 1050 cards to send to my three pals (number of deals we've done): <a href="https://www.tcdb.com/Profile.cfm/Sportzcommish" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportzcommish</a> (9), <a href="https://www.tcdb.com/Profile.cfm/Nathan-John-Mercer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nathan-John-Mercer</a> (16), and <a href="https://www.tcdb.com/Profile.cfm/mzentko" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mzentko</a> (4). About halfway through, my favorite breaker, <a href="https://midwestboxbreaks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midwest Box Breaks</a>, went live to rip some 2025-26 Topps Flagship. Topps recently reacquired the rights to NBA cards after almost 2 decades and these are the most anticipated basketball cards in a looooong time so it was a fun watch and learn. Capture the Cooper Flagg is sweeping the globe.

Once everything was all packed up and ready to go, I took my weekly (ish) hike to the local post office, with a quick pit-stop at Xpress Diner along the way. Skillet szn.

Anywho, don't tell the United States Postal Service, but I've taken everything that Clipse has taught me and I'm steady flippin' bricks across state and international (arbitrary) borders.

Shouts to our next state, Oh Canada.
