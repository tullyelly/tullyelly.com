Retired a legacy portion of the menu system today. This is intended to address some flakiness when deploying any new code to the application. Plus, it also was no longer needed. So there's that.

Nate Bargatze was pretty funny last night. The lady friend was tickled, so W.

Here's a brief review of each comedian that was part of the show:

- Host: <a href="https://nateland.com/pages/derrick-stroup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Derrick Stroup</a> (5/10); Understandably nervous for 20,000 of us. Too much crowd work, hard to judge.

  (5/10); Darker, a little more dry. I doubt this was a fair representation of
  his full work.

Today's primary adventure was to find an outfit for my interview on Tuesday. I've basically donated or thrown away all of the clothes from the last time I had a job, so it's time to start building that inventory back up again. Found some stuff in Gurnee Mills to get most of the job done. Next up, shoes.

One love.
