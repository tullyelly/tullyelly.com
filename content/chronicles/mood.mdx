I'm not in a very good mood today. Sometimes there's only so much smiling through the complaining that one man can take. Maybe we should all think about how we all contribute to the BS we bitch about every day and then shut the fuck up already.

In other news, today I was in a group of 20 or so new hires who met with the top dog in our portion of the org chart and I really like him. He's spent the better part of a decade working to make the local job market a place that his kids would want to stay within. Cool, calm, and collected. Minimal ego.

That couldn't break through the mood though.
