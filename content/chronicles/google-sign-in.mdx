I did a little work today to bring some existing login functionality to the forefront. Two things of note:

- A Google account is required
- This does not currently enable or restrict any functionality, that's coming next

---

But then I got sucked into messing with the UI for the desktop menu and I continue to not like it. I'm reminded of the days I tried to hack away at this to find something that I liked.

It would appear that I am still in a stalemate with myself - perhaps the menu is improved overall, and yet, still annoying with a few visual ticks that leave my OCD twitchy.

Moving along.

Back to accounts, please open up the menu, click the Sign In button, and use your Google Account to login. I'm lazy right now so we'll just see if you smart enough to get logged in without any additional context clues or training.

I believe in you.

Once you are logged in, open the menu, click on your name, and then please play with that functionality. What you see in your profile is the extent of what information I'm collecting or using for authority checks throughout the site. As a new user, you will only see what Google passes to the site, most of it technical bits that are meaningless.

Minimal Viable Product (MVP) aka good enough for now.

Moving along.

I'm also not thrilled that the UI for signing in is so different from the rest of the rest, but we'll circle those wagons down the road.

Moving along.

Iterate. Iterate. Iterate.
