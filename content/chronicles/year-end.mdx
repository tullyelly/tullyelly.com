Let's continue on the year end snapshot tip. I rebooted my computer, discord popped open, and dropped this one me:

I actually don't use discord much and while it's still on [mark2](/mark2), I've turned off all notifications for it on my phone. I've been shedding apps and notifications from my phone because it's good for me, but also because work notifications be lit bro.

That said, basketball and cards on discord - the math checks out.

Before discord came along and interrupted me I was going to post on my year end music recap so here we go:

If you've been around long enough, I've been chirping about most of this for awhile now. Take [aesop rock](/theabbott/roadwork-rappin) for example: he's OG on this site. I've got a few bigger ideas with some people I've lost touch with and he's in the mix.

Or how about [DAVEY BOY SMITH](/theabbott/heels-have-eyes)? I told you that was the banger of the year, I ain't lyin'. In the last six months, <i>westside gunn</i> is easily my most listened too artist. Sorry <i>rock</i>.

Maybe we check in on [the war on drugs](/shaolin/red-eyes) and note that that particular post([malone?](/shaolin/lulu-found-it)) is my most read chronicle.

In any case, everything you see in that screenshot has an idea attached to it. As <i>puff daddy</i> would tell you - can't stop, won't stop.

Oh, it looks like I have to let my first person go at work tomorrow. Pretty sure I'd still get a positive review from said individual, but it is what it is.
