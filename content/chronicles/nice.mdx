eeeeeeeemma was my not-so-secret santa this year and boy did she hook me up, bro. Let's step through how it progressed:

This was accomplished with charcoal, and I've got two more pieces of content coming along these lines. First, she created a certificate of authenticity for this giannis painting, and second, she has another charcoal painting that is a self-portrait.

She continues to inspire me.

I also played with some cards today and [released](/mark2/shaolin-scrolls) another big chunk of cards into my larger <i>giannis</i> reorganization project.

Cards remain few and far between these days.

A minor update to the [chronicles](/shaolin) page was deployed to address the tags taking up too much space at the top of the page. I minimized that footprint and added a [view all](/shaolin/tags) page to show all of the tags that have been used throughout this project so far.

Iterate.

Happy Holidays.
