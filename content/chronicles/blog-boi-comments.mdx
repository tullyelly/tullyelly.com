I see you <i>lulu</i>.

Spent a little time today finishing a presentation I'm going to give to a few folks at [redacted] to describe how we worked past our most recent hiccups as a team. Long story short, we attack all opportunities with:

- Transparency / Communication
- Standards
- Templates
- Roles
- Decision Paths

Along with something called universal frameworks or some such.

I'm going to two birds, one stone the situation, and practice my timing by using the same presentation with my direct reports in our weekly kickoff meeting. Ideally, they hear everything first, so I can use this same presentation to provide a similar message - except from their perspective.

I'm always on the lookout for shared efficiencies; like a presentation I can give twice; like a presentation that I can then turn around and blog about to provide a third layer of benefit......that'll keep the content machine rolling.

Next was a pit stop into the world of finiancial wellness. I dusted off the ol' budgeting tool and started to build a new footprint that includes my new [redacted] paychecks. I love me some [pocketsmith](https://www.pocketsmith.com/).

Last, but not least, I added some comments functionality that attaches to each chronicle. Check it out below and say hi! Hint, you'll need to sign in.

Productive day.
