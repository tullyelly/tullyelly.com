    Mail day!

    Who get's excited for some [1997-98 Hoops](https://www.tcdb.com/ViewSet.cfm/sid/2642/1997-98-Hoops) base cards? Me. That's who.

    67 of 330 (20.3% complete).

    Plus, if you need a good layered pumpkin cheesecake, I might know a guy:

    The cards were partially protected by this page, and the tape that came along with the deal helped to grow our [hug ball](/unclejimmy/hug-ball).

    eeeeeeeemma was kind enough to return the good luck charm I gave her for fantasy football season:

    She played fantasy football for the first time this year, used my ESPN account, and had Lamar as her QB. I'm realizing that I don't know how her season ended.

    Anywho, I "won" this card from somewhere and thought it couldn't hurt to juice the mojo. Pretty sure he had the worst season of his career. You can't win 'em all. 😏

    New Windows 11 update dropped and I was legitimately excited for this slide on the splash page:

    Like, I actually enjoy this feature and now I don't have to go to the google machine when I need an emoji for the blog. 🍆

    I apologize for the increased emoji usage to follow. 🌬️🌬️🌳🌳

  I had a late notice meeting drop on my calendar for tomorrow, and I'll be returning
  to my [seat at the table](/shaolin/seat-at-the-table). I can all but guarantee that I'll be the only one who prepared by listening to some shit with some BOP in it:

<YouTubeVideo id="28hYUZMufDg" />

Long time group chat participants will know I've been past due dropping this video here for some time now.

My name is all over the roadmap I got a brief glimpse of today.

BOP indeed.
