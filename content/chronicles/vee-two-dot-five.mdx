New month? New me? New release?

---

6 weeks ago, I looked at life and noticed that I might need a job sooner rather than later. I'd made it a year. I'd made a new robot friend since that year anniversary. And now I'd need a new team to link up with and start a new grand adventure.

As part of that, I did what I do these days and I added it to the project plan. I loosely mapped things out in my head and landed at 6 weeks. I needed a job in 6 weeks - at the very least, I better have solid options by 6 weeks. Way back at the beginning, I called the work in the last week's bucket <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOi8xaOBy9I&list=PLbbAqYIJ9AMU9dJOIT34yf4NNkL0Mb4h-&index=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">6 Feet Deep</a>.

That's a dark name that has multiple meanings to me. First, if I don't get a job in 6 weeks, maybe I'm just fucked. The real meaning sits closer to the light. The Gravediggaz album 6 Feet Deep came out very close to the first Wu-Tang Clan album and is a similar miracle collection of talent.....but that's another story for another day.

For me, it's more about numerology and naming. 6-week journey, my favorite thing with a 6 is that many Feet Deep. Wonderful mixture of meaning and nonsense. Plus, as a member of Gravediggaz, the RZA's alter ego was the RZArector, because he was digging up the mentally dead. Get it?

Since my birthday, the anniversary of the last time I stepped foot inside of that place that shall not be named, I've been digging up one specific mental grave. My own. I built my own personal RZArector to help me help me.

You are trapped inside it right now. There is no escape.

TL;DR: I accepted the offer on Friday of week 6. As the RZArector taught me in high school - Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation, Positive Energy Activates Constant Elevation.

During that same 6-week period, I've been knee deep in building out some functionality here. Most of this work fell into 4 larger chunks:

- Authority
- Menus
- Breadcrumbs
- Blogging

<br />
There's a few places on the site that I don't want anyone rummaging around in,
so I linked up to the big Google in the sky and integrated some of their
front-end login functionality with my own authz controls on the backend.
Integrating with Google was surprisingly easy, and if you want to go on an
Easter Egg hunt, you could find the page to activate the Google Machine. Let me
know if you find it - that's fun.

Next up, menus. This one was a huge pain in the ass - mostly because I'm OCD and very particular with what I want. Even though I really don't know what I want. The amount of ways you have to consider a menu (mobile, desktop, touch on desktop, yer mom, etc.) is annoying. Then add in who can see what authority, and it was a nice sized chunk of work. Works pretty good right now. Could be gooder, but that's tomorrow me who will hate that.

I haven't eaten breakfast yet today, so breadcrumbs are making me hungry right now. nikkigirl is with a friend who I'm saying isn't really a friend.....another one of those later gator stories. I'm hungry, and it's her fault, is the point. lulz

Anywho, breadcrumbs will follow you wherever you are on the site to help you jump back up the hierarchy as well as anchor you to your location on the site. Breadcrumbs if the Gravediggaz described them: there's nowhere to run, there's nowhere to hide.

And finally, we close with blog boi. Or as I have started calling them chronicles. I use chronicles all over the place. If you followed the adventure on the homepage, a blueprint is a template for my technical chronicles. A fuller breakdown of chronicles can be found in the <a href="/tullyelly/ruins">ruins</a>.

I spun up a simple blog and have been blogging every day for 2 weeks. My goal is to write something every day for a year. Good, bad, or indifferent. Write it down.

---

That's what I would consider a full release of shaolin v.2.5.0. Moving from 2.4 to 2.5 is as big a jump as I've had yet. It'll be interesting to see what inspires the need to jump from 2.5 to 2.6.......

PS, I also sorted, logged, and sleeved up 10,000+ cards during the last few weeks too. Talk to robot, sort cards, test robot's output, log cards, yell at stupid robot, sleeve cards. Rinse hands & repeat.

We'll close out with my idea generator, <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>. I use this to loosely map out ideas before turning them into the real, fake, thing. My favorite thing in Obsidian is vomiting something dumb as a placeholder and then coming along 4 days later to vomit something else, only to realize it's just two nodes on a bigger idea. The thrill of the chase.

Here's a visualiztion of that journey as it sits today:

<LoopedGIF src="/videos/obsidian.webp" alt="Brain Map" />
<br />
Quality of that GIF is shit, but we are in deploy it and don't OCD it mode. All
of these nodes are future ideas or labels to pull these future ideas together.
Ultimately, I'm trying to find a way to visualize my thought processes and keep
myself entertained along the way.

Check back tomorrow, we might have a guest blogger.

Hug ball.
