          First stop, the Little Diner Xpress. When I wander off to the east
          (shouts to Pete&apos;s Auto) I like to stop at this diner and have
          some breakfast, whether is actually breakfast, lunch, or dinner. I
          would eat breakfast for every meal if I could, but I digress. I was
          talking to dad earlier this month about George Webb having a location
          in Appleton years ago, and it turns out, this is that location. What a
          coinky-dink. Go Brew Crew.

          Next stop, the US Postal Service. Speaking of randy, there are few
          things that get me more excited than the USPS. Ask around, it is true.
          More on this to close the post.

          My plan was to walk up to one of the associates behind the counter
          that would recognize me and have some fun with them, asking for some
          cute stamps and a selfie so I could show lulu. Instead, it was someone
          I do not interact with much, and when I tell you she was dead inside,
          I mean she was really dead inside. There was no fun to be had. USPS
          workers are the real MVP - they hate their job regardless of the
          current president, so in some ways, we could all take some inspiration
          from them.

        <p className="text-[16px] text-muted-foreground md:text-[18px]">
          I also forgot to take a selfie of the Post Office, but guess what? A
          truck stopped on the street on my way home. I was very excited for the
          help, as per usual. You can see the middle school the little two went
          too behind us. Middle school is for suckers. So says lulu and my
          teacher friends - I do not make up the rules.

          basic menus setup in the next few days and based upon this post, as

          And then last, but not least, how about we chat about how amazing the
          USPS and TCDb are. My very first trade on TCDb was 2021-02-13. Since
          then, I have completed 2047 trades, 100% through the US Postal
          Service. While there have been a snafu or two, they deliver at a
          percentage that is entirely amazing. They are fantastic and I will not
          hear otherwise. Plus, spend a few hours waiting in line at the post
          office and you will begin to appreciate the absolute mountain of
          bullshit the employees go through with our fellow man. God bless the
          USPS.

        <p className="text-[16px] text-muted-foreground md:text-[18px]">
          A few more stats before we close - within those 2047 trades was a
          total of 76,214 cards (34,076 sent and 42,138 received). I have traded
          with 49 of the 50 states, including a few military bases that count as
          a state on the site, and 14 different countries - to include 794
          unique partners. The most trades I have done with one individual is 24
          with Shin in the San Francisco area. He is one of handful of people I
          have saved as a contact on my phone, and I would loosely consider him
          a friend, if not my best penpal.
