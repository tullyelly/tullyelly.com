            <strong>About Aesop Rock</strong>
            <br />
            Aesop Rock (Ian Bavitz) is a New Yorkâ€“born rapper and producer celebrated for his dense, surreal lyricism and lasting influence on underground hip-hop. What makes him truly stand out is his vocabulary: studies show heâ€™s used more unique words across his career than any other major rapper, a linguistic range so vast it even rivals Shakespeare. That love of language defines his styleâ€”songs that unfold like puzzles, packed with imagery and ideas that reward repeated listens.
