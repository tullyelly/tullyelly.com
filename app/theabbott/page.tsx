          A cipher may be used in cryptography as an algorithm for performing
          encryption or decryption. A cipher can be applied to writing in a such
          a way to hide secrets or disguise one&rsquo;s writing. A cipher can be
          a group of emcees performing together to demonstrate their skills,
          often in competition, typically while forming a circle. A cipher can
          also represent zero or a circle, ya dig?

          I prefer the traditional hip-hop use of the term or as pops would call
          it &quot;best idea wins&quot;.

        <p className="text-[16px] md:text-[18px] text-muted-foreground">
          I will engage with any idea: big or small. I am also hardwired and
          driven by the need to either improve an idea or discard an idea as
          quickly as humanly possible. On the plus side of this ledger, I can
          rapidly help anyone or anything improve - often in ways not readily
          apparent to those around me. On the dark side of this ledger, I can be
          cold and unsentimental when brushing off ideas I know to be lacking -
          often in ways that harm and damage those around me.

          Fear not tho fellow travelers, steps have been taken to minimize the
          risks and downsides of stepping into my cipher and I&rsquo;m confident
          you will find much fun to be had. Your risk is worth our reward.

            oh, and cypher from the matrix is a judas type who betrays our boi
            neo. I also call the AI agent (Codex) in ChatGPT cipher in part
